# 2 Thermodynamics

## Introduction

Thermodynamics is a fundamental scientific discipline that is applicable in a wide range of fields and systems, both natural and man-made. It is used to describe and predict the behavior of systems that exchange energy, work, and heat with their surroundings. The systems studied using this approach can be from a microscopic- to planetary-scales.  Some examples of natural and human systems that can be studied using a thermodynamic approach are outlined below.

In this example on the impact of climate change - scientists use principles of thermodynamics to predict how various parts of the Earth system respond to the changing climate.

Economists can also explain supply chains and manufacturing processes using thermodynamic principles.

Earth's interior including the mantle and the plate tectonic theory can be quantified using the principles of thermodynamics. The Earth can be studied from a classic systems perspective that makes the application of thermodynamics very helpful.

The world's scientists and governments are banking on "green" solutions as an answer to solving the climate crisis.  However, thermodynamic principles can help us better identify which types of solutions are more feasible than others.

Equilibrium thermodynamics focuses on prediction of concentrations of all species and phases present at the end of a reaction at equilibrium. Kinetics focuses on the rate at which reactions occur. In this section we focus on fundamental ideas of thermodynamics and also on their applications in the field of environmental geochemistry.

This chapter provides a basic understanding of chemical thermodynamics, which is the basis for all of chemical equilibria. We describe the basic concepts, principal functions of state, and laws of thermodynamics and show how these concepts are used to define the equilibrium conditions for chemical processes. The effects of temperature and pressure on thermodynamic functions of state and on chemical equilibria also are developed, and examples are provided throughout the chapter to illustrate applications of important thermodynamic principles and equations.

## Learning Goals

```{admonition} Learning Goals

The main goals for this chapter are to:
1. learn the basic terminology of thermodynamics - including, work, energy, systems, and state variables,
2. identify how energy is transferred between systems and their surroundings, and 
3. define and apply the laws of thermodynamics and the fundamental thermodynamic properties, including enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy.
