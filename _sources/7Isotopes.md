# 7 Environmental Isotopes

## Introduction

Isotopes are used in many ways to understand Earth’s history and how environmental processes occur on Earth. For example, isotopes of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen are used to study past climates and environments by analyzing the isotopic composition of fossils and sediments. Isotopes of uranium and lead are used to date rocks and minerals. Isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen are used to study the water cycle and past climates. Isotopes of argon are used to date volcanic rocks. These are just a few examples of how isotopes are used in geology and geochemistry.

### Radioisotopes in Geosciences

Radioisotopes are important for understanding the Earth in a number of ways. They can be used to date rocks and minerals, helping geologists to understand the history of the Earth and the processes that have shaped it. Radioisotopes can also be used to study the movements and behavior of elements in the Earth's crust and mantle, giving us a better understanding of the Earth's internal structure and processes. In addition, radioisotopes are used in the field of environmental science to study the movement of elements and compounds through ecosystems, and to understand the processes that control the distribution and behavior of elements in the environment.

Radioisotope decay is also harnessed to generate power. Nuclear power is generated through the process of nuclear fission. In a nuclear power plant, fuel rods containing uranium or other fissile materials are placed inside a reactor. When a neutron hits the nucleus of a uranium atom, it causes the nucleus to split into two smaller atoms, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This energy is used to heat water, which produces steam that drives a turbine connected to a generator. The generator converts the mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energy, which is then sent to the grid for distribution to homes and businesses.

The process of nuclear fission also releases additional neutrons, which can be captured by other uranium atoms, creating a chain reaction. The rate at which the chain reaction occurs is carefully controlled by the use of control rods, which can absorb excess neutrons and slow down the reaction. The heat produced by the nuclear reaction is removed from the reactor by a cooling system, which prevents the fuel rods from overheating and melting.

Nuclear power has the potential to be a low-carbon source of electricity that can help to address climate change. Because nuclear reactions release a large amount of energy with minimal carbon emissions, nuclear power plants can generate electricity with fewer greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuel-fired power plants.

However, nuclear power is not without its challenges. One of the main concerns is the management of nuclear waste, which can remain radioactive for thousands of years and requires careful disposal. In addition, the construction of nuclear power plants can be expensive and time-consuming, and there are concerns about the safety of nuclear power plants, especially in the wake of accidents such as the Fukushima disaster in Japan.

Overall, the role of nuclear power in addressing climate change will depend on the ability to address these challenges and on the availability of other low-carbon energy sources. Some experts believe that a mix of low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear power, will be necessary to meet the global demand for electricity while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

### Stable Isotopes in Geosciences

Water isotopes, particularly isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, are used to study climate because they can provide information about the sources, movements, and histories of water in the Earth's hydrological cycle. Different isotopes of water have different properties and behave differently in the environment, so by measuring the relative abundance of different isotopes in water samples, scientists can learn about the conditions under which the water was formed and the processes it has undergone.

For example, the ratio of heavy isotopes (such as deuterium) to light isotopes (such as hydrogen) in water can be used to trace the source and movement of water, as well as to understand the temperature and humidity conditions in the atmosphere. Similarly, the ratio of oxygen isotopes in water can be used to infer information about the temperature and humidity of the air when the water was evaporated, as well as the altitude at which the water precipitated.

By studying the isotopic composition of water from various sources and locations, scientists can build a picture of the Earth's hydrological cycle and how it has changed over time, providing valuable insights into past and present climate conditions.

## Learning Goals

```{admonition} Learning Goals

The main goals for this chapter are to:

1. describe radio and stable isotopes of elements,
2. explain how isotopes partition into different geological environments, and
3. how isotopes can help are used to understand contemporary and historical geological processes.
