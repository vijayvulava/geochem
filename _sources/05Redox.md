# Redox Chemistry

## Introduction

Earth’s atmosphere contains about $\pu{20 \%}$ molecular oxygen, $\ce{O2 (g)}$, a chemically reactive gas that plays an essential role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in many environmental processes that shape the world. The term oxidation was originally used to describe chemical reactions involving $\ce{O2 (g)}$, but its meaning has evolved to refer to a broad and important reaction class known as _oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions_. 

In this chapter, we focus on how loss or gain of electrons can impact elements and their behavior in the environment. Below are some basic examples of redox reactions that occur on Earth, both naturally and due to human actions.

### Acid Rain

Coal from the Appalachian Mountains have naturally higher sulfur content, due to their geological origin in the ocean basins. This coal is also the most common type of coal consumed in most of the eastern half of the US. When this coal is combusted, S is oxidized as shown in the reaction below to form $\ce{SO2(g)}$. Subsequent oxidation reaction turns $\ce{SO2(g)}$ into $\ce{SO3(g)}$, which leads to formation of sulfuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$) by combining with water. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and leads to acid rain as well as acidification of natural streams, leading to deleterious impacts on overall environments.

$$ 
\begin{align*} 
\ce{
S(s) + O2(g) &-> SO2(g\\
2 SO2(g) + O2(g) &-> 2 SO3(g) \\
SO3(g) + H2O(l) &-> H2SO4(aq) \\
H2SO4(aq) &-> H+(aq) + HSO4^-(aq) &
} 
\end{align*} 
$$

### Acid Mine Drainage

Metal-bearing sulfide minerals such as iron, copper, and lead pyrites ($\ce{FeS2}$, $\ce{Cu2S}$, and $\ce{PbS}$), are stable in reducing environments but break down in oxidizing environments driven by oxidation of the sulfide anion ($\ce{S^2-}$) to $\ce{S^6+}$ (present in $\ce{SO4^2-}$), can result in release of trace metals and arsenic to soils and aquatic systems.

$$ 
\begin{align*} 
\ce{
FeS2 + 14 Fe^3+ + 8 H2O &-> 16 H+ + 15 Fe^2+ + 2 SO4^2-\\
PbS + 8 Fe^3+ + 4 H2O &-> 8 H+ + SO4^2- + Pb^2+ + 8 Fe^2+
} \end{align*} $$

A by-product of these reactions is the large-scale release of acids ($\ce{H+}$ in the above reactions) into stream environments. Often, $p\ce{H}$ drops to levels that cannot sustain any aquatic life.

### Arsenic in Bengal Basin

Arsenic poisoning and the health emergency in Bengal Basin of the Indian subcontinent. The shallow aquifer materials in the Bengal Basic naturally contain thick deposits of arsenopyrite ($\ce{FeAsS}$) minerals. To address high infant mortality rates in Bangladesh, the WHO recommended and funded a large-scale installation of groundwater wells as groundwater naturally contained low bacteria compared to stream water. During pumping of groundwater, the extensive drawdown of the water table allowed reduction of ferric ($\ce{Fe^3+}$) to ferrous ($\ce{Fe^2+}$) iron and dissolution of iron hydroxides, which in turn released arsenic into solution. Aquifers where dissolved arsenic was once well below drinking-water standards (e.g., $\pu{10 ppb}$ in the USA) can experience substantial increases of dissolved arsenic that exceed safe drinking water standards.

### Chromium in Groundwater

Groundwater contamination during unregulated dumping of $\ce{Cr(VI)}$ ($\ce{Cr^6+}$) waste by a large electrical utility, PG&E, into unlined soil pits created a health emergency in the community of Hinkley, CA. The $\ce{Cr}$ waste seeped into the aquifer and created a large plume that went undetected until the contaminated well water created many health problems in the local community. Since $\ce{Cr(VI)}$ is present in water as an oxyanion ($\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$ or $\ce{CrO4^2-}$), it is not "attracted" (sorbed) to aquifer materials, this form of Cr can easily be transported in groundwater environments. Typically, treatment of this form requires that $\ce{Cr^6+}$ to be reduced to $\ce{Cr^3+}$, which is less toxic.

### Excess nutrients in water

Large-scale factory-farming practices use excessive fertilizers to increase crop and animal yield. A by-product of these practices is the discharge of large concentrations of nutrient elements such as $\ce{N}$ and $\ce{P}$ in stream runoff. The excess $\ce{N}$ and $\ce{P}$ in the final receiving bodies of water result in an increase in algal populations in water. Excess algae create "blooms" that can be seen in the form of green pigments that float on water. Eutrophication, where degradation of algae in water bodies reduces available dissolved $\ce{N}$ and $\ce{O2(aq)}$ (DO) in the water. Aerobic microbial organisms responsible for degradation (consumption) of algae also consume during this process. Ultimately, DO reduces to a dangerously low level that is detrimental to aquatic and marine life. Excess fertilizer discharge in stream runoff have created "dead zones" and harmful algal blooms (HAB) in the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes, and along the Atlantic coastal areas. Highly oxygenated surface waters in cool streams and lakes typically contain $\pu{7-9 mg L-1}$ of DO. Wetlands and groundwater contain naturally lower amounts of DO than do surface waters (e.g., groundwater generally contain DO from $\pu{1-6 mg L-1}$ while wetlands can vary between oxic and anoxic conditions). In aquatic environments, DO levels below $\pu{5-6 mg L-1}$ are detrimental to aquatic life.

## Oxidation and Reduction Reactions

Oxidation and reduction, or more simply, redox reactions are chemical reactions in which electrons (denoted by $\ce{e-}$) are transferred from one atom to another. An element is ***oxidized*** when it loses an electron, and ***reduction*** of an element occurs when it gains an electron. Redox reactions involve simultaneous oxidation of one element and reduction of another.

```{dropdown} Example: Oxidation and reduction reactions 

Let's identify what's being oxidized and reduced in the reactions below:

$$
\ce{
2 Na + Cl2 &-> 2 Na+ + 2 Cl- \\
&-> 2 NaCl
} $$

Here is $\ce{Na}$ is losing $\ce{e-}$ to become $\ce{Na+}$ and is oxidized. Also, $\ce{Cl2}$ is gaining $\ce{e-}$ to become $\ce{Cl-}$ and is reduced.

$$ 
\begin{align*} 
\ce{
2 Fe + O2 &-> 2 Fe^2+ + 2O^2- \\
&-> 2 FeO
} \end{align*} $$

Here $\ce{Fe}$ is losing $\ce{e-}$ to become $\ce{Fe^2+}$ and is oxidized.
While, $\ce{O2}$ is gaining $\ce{e-}$ to become $\ce{O^2-}$ and is reduced.
```

It is often convenient to represent "half" of a redox reaction - the oxidation half or the reduction half. Reactions that only show the oxidation or reduction of an element are called half reactions. Half-reactions are helpful in balancing redox reactions.

```{dropdown} Example: Oxidation and reduction half-reactions 

Below are examples of oxidation reactions where an element loses $\ce{e-}$.

$$ \begin{align*} \ce{
Fe(s) &-> Fe^2+ + 2 e- \\
&-> Fe^3+ + 3 e- \\
C(s) &-> C^4+ + 4 e-
} \end{align*} $$

Below are examples of a reduction reactions where an element gains $\ce{e-}$.

$$ \begin{align*} 
\ce{
O + 2 e- &-> O^2- \\
N + 3 e- &-> N^3-
} 
\end{align*} $$
```

The above examples are shown in the form of a ***half-reaction***, where oxidation or reduction of an element is clearly shown. Note that there are no free $\ce{e-}$ possible. Every oxidation reaction is to be accompanied by a reduction reaction(s), where are the $\ce{e-}$ are consumed. The above sets of half-reactions can be combined in such a way that the final redox reaction will show no free $\ce{e-}$.

```{dropdown} Example: Balancing half-reactions 

Let's combine the and reactions to write a balanced redox reaction. Since each half-reaction produces 2   while half-reaction requires 4 , multiply half-reaction by 2. Now combine both half-reactions and cancel the .

$$ \begin{align*} 
\ce{
2 Fe(s) &-> 2 Fe^2+ + 4e- \\
O2(g) + 4 e- &-> 2 O^2- \\
\\
2 Fe(s) + O2(g) &-> 2 Fe^2+ + 2 O^2-
} 
\end{align*} $$

Note: The $\ce{e-}$ from the half-reactions appear on opposite sides to be able to cancel out.
```
 

Since any reduced element is capable of releasing $\ce{e-}$ that can combine with (i.e., reduce) another element, reduced compounds are sometimes referred to as reducing agents or reductants. Similarly, oxidized elements are capable of gaining $\ce{e-}$ from other elements; in the process, the (initially) oxidized element becomes reduced and acts as an oxidizing agent or oxidant.

```{dropdown} Example: Oxidizing and reducing agents 

Let's identify the oxidant and reductant in the following reaction:

$$\ce{
2 Fe + O2 -> 2 FeO
}$$

On left-side of reaction, $\ce{Fe}$ is "helping" $\ce{O2}$ reduce is, hence, a reducing agent. Likewise, $\ce{O2}$ is helping $\ce{Fe}$ oxidize and is, hence, an oxidizing agent.
```


## Oxidation State

The oxidation state (OS), describes the degree of oxidation of an atom in a chemical compound. Oxidation states provide us with a way to balance electrons in a chemical equation. It is the charge an atom would have if electrons were transferred completely. Conceptually, the oxidation state is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were $\pu{100 \%}$ ionic, with no covalent component. Oxidation states are typically represented by integers which may be positive, zero, or negative. In some cases, the average oxidation state of an element is a fraction (in complex organic molecules).

Oxidation numbers enable us to identify elements that are oxidized and reduced at a glance. The elements that show an increase in oxidation state are being oxidized, whereas the elements that show a decrease in oxidation state are being reduced.

```{admonition} Rules for Determining Oxidation State (OS)

1. OS of a free element $=0$. E.g., $\ce{Na}$, $\ce{Be}$, $\ce{K}$, $\ce{Pb}$, $\ce{H2}$, $\ce{O2}$, $=0$
2. For monoatomic ions $=$ net charge on ion. E.g., $\ce{Na+} = +1$,
$\ce{Fe^3+} = +3$, $\ce{O^2-} = -2$
3. OS of $\ce{O} = -2$ in most cmpounds. Exception: OS $= -1$ in $\ce{H2O2}$
4. OS of $\ce{H}$ $= +1$. Exception: OS $= -1$ in metal hydrides (e.g., $\ce{LiH}$)
5. Group I metals $= +1$
6. Group II metals $= +2$
7. Halides $=$ negative
8. Algebraic sum of OS in neutral molecules $= 0$
9. Algebraic sum of OS in ionic molecules $=$ charge on ion
10. OS can be a fraction
```

```{dropdown} Example: Determining oxidation states of nitrogen 

Let's determine the OS of $\ce{N}$ in $\ce{NH3}$, $\ce{NO3-}$, $\ce{NO2-}$, and $\ce{N2}$. Per the OS rules, OS for $\ce{H}$ and $\ce{O}$ in these compounds are $+1$ and $-2$, respectively.

We can use a simple algebra trick to determine the OS for an unknown. Let's start with $\ce{NH3}$. Let's call OS of $\ce{N}$ as $x$. Therefore $x+3(+1) = 0$, based on the rules specified above. Or, $x = -3$, or OS for $\ce{N}$ in $\ce{NH3}$ is 3.

Similarly, let's write the algebraic notation for $\ce{NO3-}$. $x+3(-2) = -1$ or, $x = +5$.

Therefore, the OS of all $\ce{N}$ compounds are:
1. $\ce{NH3}$ : $-3$
2. $\ce{NO3-}$: $+5$
3. $\ce{NO2-}$: $+3$
4. $\ce{N2}$: $0$

We can rank these $\ce{N}$ compounds from the most oxidized to most reduced forms as follows: $\ce{NO3-}$, $\ce{NO2-}$, $\ce{N2}$, and $\ce{NH3}$.
```
 

## Balancing Redox Reactions

For balancing redox reactions, we balance the elements on each side of the equation arrow, as well as the electrons.

```{admonition} Balancing redox reactions 

Follow steps below in sequence to balance redox reactions.
1. Identify the OS of all major elements
2. Place $\ce{e-}$  where appropriate in skeletal reaction
3. Place $\ce{e-}$  where appropriate in actual reaction
4. Adjust stoichiometry of main element only
5. Add $\ce{H2O}$ on appropriate side of reaction to balance $\ce{O}$ 
6. Add $\ce{H+}$ on appropriate side to balance $\ce{H}$ 
7. Verify charge balance on both sides of reaction
8. Combine half-reactions such that all $\ce{e-}$  are consumed - factor half reactions as required
9. Verify stoichiometry and charge balance of final reaction
```

```{dropdown} Example: Balancing redox reactions 

Let's balance the following redox reaction:

$$\ce{
SO4^2- + FeO -> H2S + FeOOH
}$$

This reaction involves two redox "couples":

Step 1: Identify the OS of all major elements

| Chemical    | OS | Chemical | OS |
|-------------|------: |----------|------: |
| $\ce{SO4^2-}$ | $+6$   | $\ce{H2S}$ | $-2$   |
| $\ce{FeOOH}$  | $+3$   | $\ce{FeO}$ | $+2$   |

Step 2: Place $\ce{e-}$ where appropriate in skeletal rxn

$$ \begin{align*} 
\ce{
S(VI) + 8 e- &-> S(-II)\\
Fe(III) + e- &-> Fe(II)
} \end{align*} $$

Step 3: Place $\ce{e-}$ where appropriate in actual rxn

$$ \begin{align*} 
\ce{
SO4^2- + 8 e- &-> H2S\\
FeOOH + e- &-> FeO
} \end{align*} $$

Step 4: Adjust stoichiometry of main elements (in the example below they are already balanced)

$$ \begin{align*} 
\ce{
SO4^2- + 8 e- &-> H2S\\
FeOOH + e- &-> FeO
} \end{align*} $$

Step 5: Add $\ce{H2O}$ to balance $\ce{O}$

$$ \begin{align*} 
\ce{
SO4^2- + 8 e- &-> H2S + 4 H2O\\
FeOOH + e- &-> FeO + H2O
} \end{align*} $$

Step 6: Add $\ce{H+}$ to balance $\ce{O}$

$$ \begin{align*} 
\ce{
SO4^2- + 8 e- + 10 H+ &-> H2S + 4 H2O\\
FeOOH + e- + H+ &-> FeO + H2O
} \end{align*} $$

Step 7: Verify charge balance on both sides of rxn

Step 8a: Combine half-rxn such that all $\ce{e-}$ are consumed.  In this case multiply the $\ce{Fe}$ half-reaction by a factor $8$ to have same number of $\ce{e-}$.  

$$ \begin{align*} 
\ce{
SO4^2- + 8 e- + 10 H+ &-> H2S + 4 H2O\\
8FeOOH + 8e- + 8H+ &-> 8FeO + 8H2O
} \end{align*} $$

Step 8b: Combine half-rxn such that all $\ce{e-}$ are consumed.  Reverse the 2nd reaction so that the $\ce{e-}$ are on the opposite sides of the reactions. Now, all $\ce{e-}$ can be cancelled.

$$ \begin{align*} 
\ce{
SO4^2- + 8 e- + 10 H+ &-> H2S + 4 H2O\\
8 FeO + 8 H2O &-> 8 FeOOH + 8 e- + 8 H+
} \end{align*} $$

Step 9: Add both half-reactions and check stoichiometry and charge balance on final reaction

$$ \ce{
SO4^2- + 8 FeO + 2 H+ + 4 H2O -> H2S + 8 FeOOH
}$$

$\ce{FeO}$ is oxidized by $\ce{SO4^2-}$!

```{dropdown} Example: Balancing redox reactions -- Case Study 1 

Groundwater is an anoxic environment where dissolved iron exists as $\ce{Fe^2+}$. When this water is pumped to the surface, $\ce{O2(g)}$ in atmosphere oxidizes $\ce{Fe^2+}$, into an insoluble precipitate $\ce{Fe(OH)3 (s)}$ depending on $p\ce{H}$ conditions. Let's write the half-reactions and the overall redox reaction.

(1) The half-reactions

$$ \begin{align} \ce{
    Fe^2+ + 3 H2O &<=> Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ + e- \\
    O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e- &<=> 2 H2O
} \end{align} $$

(2) The overall redox reaction

$$\ce{
    4 Fe^2+ + O2 + 10 H2O <=> 4 Fe(OH)3 + 8 H+
}$$
```


```{dropdown} Example: Balancing redox reactions -- Case Study 2 

Ammonia (as $\ce{NH3}$) in fertilizers discharged into natural surface waters is often oxidized to $\ce{NO3-}$ by bacteria using dissolved oxygen. This process is called nitrification. Let's write the half-reactions and the overall redox reaction.

(1) The half-reactions

$$\begin{align} \ce{
    NH4+ + 3 H2O &<=> NO3- + 10 H+ + 8 e- \\
    O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e- &<=> 2 H2O
} \end{align} $$

(2) The overall redox reaction

$$ \ce{
    NH4+ + 2 O2 <=> NO3- + 2 H+ + H2O
 }$$
```


```{dropdown} Example: Balancing redox reactions - Case Study 3 

$\ce{SO4^2-(aq)}$ in ocean water is often reduced to $\ce{H2S(g)}$ by abundant organic matter ($\ce{CH2O}$ in simplified form) present in saltmarsh environments. $\ce{CO2(g)}$ is a common by-product during this process. Let's write the half-reactions and the overall redox reaction.

(1) The half-reactions

$$ \begin{align} \ce{
    SO4^2- + 10 H+ + 8 e- &<=> H2S + 4 H2O\\
    CH2O + H2O &<=> CO2 + 4 H+ + 4 e-
    } \end{align} $$

(2) The overall redox reaction

$$ \ce{
    SO4^2- + 2 CH2O + 2 H+ <=> H2S + 2 CO2 + 2 H2O
    } $$
```


```{dropdown} Example: Balancing redox reactions - Case Study 4 

Acid mine drainage is cause by the oxidation of pyrite ($\ce{FeS2(s)}$) when it comes in contact with water containing dissolved oxygen. The base reaction is:

$$\ce{
FeS2 + O2 -> Fe(OH)3 + SO4^2-
}$$

In this reaction, three elements ($\ce{Fe}$, $\ce{S}$, and $\ce{O}$) participate in the overall redox reaction.

(1) The half-reactions
 
 $$ \begin{align} 
 \ce{
    Fe^2+ &-> Fe^3+ + e- \\
    2 S- + 8 H2O &-> 2 SO4^2- + 14 e- + 16 H+ \\
    O2 + 4 e- + 2 H+ &-> 2 OH-
    } \end{align} $$

(2) The overall redox reaction

$$ \begin{align} \ce{
    4 FeS2 + 15 O2 + 14 H2O -> 4 Fe(OH)3 + 8 SO4^2- + 16 H+
    } \end{align} $$

In this case, both $\ce{Fe}$ and $\ce{S}$ are oxidized by $\ce{O2}$.

## Chemical Equilibrium and Electron Activity

Aqueous solutions do not contain free protons ($\ce{H+}$) and free electrons ($\ce{e-}$), but it is nevertheless possible to define relative and  activities. The  $p\ce{H}$ ($=-\log\{\ce{H+}\}$), measures the relative abundance of protons. Similarly, we can define an equally convenient parameter for the redox intensity $pe$ ($=-\log\{e^-\}$).  $pe$ gives the (hypothetical) electron activity at equilibrium and measures the relative tendency of a solution to accept or transfer electrons. In a highly reducing solution the tendency to donate electrons, that is, electron activity, is relatively large. Just as the activity of protons is very low at high $p\ce{H}$, the activity of hypothetical electrons is very low at high $pe$. Thus, a high $pe$ indicates a relatively high tendency for oxidation. In equilibrium equations, $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{e-}$ are treated in an analogous way.

All redox reactions, including half-reactions follow the same principles of thermodynamics (e.g., spontaneity, etc.) and can be described using chemical equilibrium principles (e.g., law of mass action, Le Châtelier's principle, etc.) Using these equilibrium principles allow us to explore oxidation and reduction problems effectively.

```{dropdown} Example: What is $pe$? 

Consider the $\ce{Fe}$ reduction half-reaction as shown below:

$$\ce{
Fe^3+ + e- -> Fe^2+ \quad\quad $K$
}$$


Note that this reaction has an equilibrium constant, $K$. Using the law of mass action, we can write the equilibrium expression as

$$
K = \frac{\{\ce{Fe^2+}\}}{\{\ce{Fe^3+}\}\{e^-\}}
$$ 

Rearrange equilibrium expression, 

$$
\{e^-\}  = \left[
\frac{1}{K}\frac{\{\ce{Fe^2+}\}}{\{\ce{Fe^3+}\}}
\right]$$ 

Apply $-\log_{10}$ on both sides, 

$$
-\log \{e^-\} = p\text{e} 
= \left[ \log K - \log \frac{\{\ce{Fe^2+}\}}{\{\ce{Fe^3+}\}} \right]
$$
```


```{dropdown} Example: What does the $pe$ value signify? 

Let's explore what the $pe$ value represents using the $\ce{Fe}$ reduction example.

$$\ce{
Fe^3+ + e- -> Fe^2+ \qquad $K$
} $$

When $\ce{e-}$ activity is lowered ($pe$ value is high), the above reaction shifts to the left, based on our understanding of chemical equilibrium principles. That is, the conditions lead to more oxidized form of $\ce{Fe}$ ($\ce{Fe^3+}$). Therefore, high $pe$ values imply strong oxidizing conditions.

When $\ce{e-}$ activity increases ($pe$ value is low), the above reaction shifts to the right, leading to the reduced form of $\ce{Fe}$ ($\ce{Fe^2+}$). Therefore, low $pe$ values imply strong reducing conditions.
```

```{dropdown} Example: Calculating $pe$ in $\ce{Fe}$ system 

Let's calculate $pe$ in the above $\ce{Fe}$ system, if $\ce{Fe^3+} = \pu{e-5 M}$, $\ce{Fe^2+} = \pu{e-3 M}$, & $K=\pu{e13}$

$$ \ce{
Fe^3+ + e- -> Fe^2+ \qquad $K$
} $$

Substitute known data in the $K$ expression: 

$$\begin{align}
\{e^-\}  &= \left[
\frac{1}{K}\frac{\{\ce{Fe^2+}\}}{\{\ce{Fe^3+}\}}
\right] = \frac{1}{\pu{e13}}\frac{\pu{e-3}}{\pu{e-5}} = \pu{e-11}\\
\therefore pe &= 11
\end{align}$$
```


```{dropdown} Example: Calculating $pe$ in $\ce{Mn}$ system 

Pyrolusite $\ce{MnO2 (s)}$ reduces in the environment as shown in the half-reaction below:

$$ \ce{
MnO2(s) + 4 H+ + 2 e- -> Mn^2+ + 2 H2O(l)
} $$

Let's write the $K$ expression for this reaction.

$$K = \frac{ \{\ce{Mn^2+}\} \{\ce{H2O(l)}\}^2}{\{\ce{MnO2(s)}\}\{\ce{H+}\}^4 \{e^-\}^2}
$$

Per chemical equilibrium "rules," activities of pure solids and liquids are equal to $1$. Therefore, $\{\ce{MnO2(s)}\} = \{\ce{H2O(l)}\} = 1$. The $K$ expression can be simplified and rearranged as 

$$\begin{align}
        K &= \frac{\{\ce{Mn^2+}\}}{\{\ce{H+}\}^4 \{e^-\}^2}\\
        \{e^-\}^2 &= \left[\frac{1}{K} \frac{\{\ce{Mn^2+}\}}{\{\ce{H+}\}^4} \right] \\
        \text{Apply}\ -\log_{10}\ \text{on both sides}\\
        pe &= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \log K - \log \{\ce{Mn^2+}\} -4p\ce{H} \right] 
\end{align}$$

If the unknown values (e.g., $\{\ce{Mn^2+}\}$, $p\ce{H}$, and $K$) are given in the above system, $pe$ can be determined.
```

###  $pe$ and $p\ce{H}$ relationships

Two components - protons ($\ce{H+}$) and electrons ($\ce{e-}$) - are omnipresent in the natural aqueous environments. In many half-reactions, both $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{e-}$ participate to facilitate the redox transformation. Consider the reduction of hematite ($\ce{Fe2O3(s)}$) mineral into $\ce{Fe^2+(aq)}$ during weathering reactions. The balanced half-reaction can be shown as:

$$\ce{
Fe2O3 + 2e- + 6 H+ -> 2 Fe^2+ + 3 H2O \qquad $K$
}$$

The $pe$ expression for the above reaction can be derived from the equilibrium expression (rearrange the $\{\ce{e-}\}$ and apply $-\log_{10}$) to arrive at the following equation:

$$pe = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \log K - \log \frac{\{\ce{Fe2+}\}^2}{\{\ce{Fe2O3}\}} -6 p\ce{H} \right]$$

It can be seen from this expression that $pe$ is related to $p\ce{H}$.

### Redox Potential, $Eh$

Redox half-reactions explicitly involve $\ce{e-}$ and the law of mass action expressions show activities and/or concentrations of all participants in those reactions are determinable. However, concentrations or activities of the $\ce{e-}$ are not measurable directly. Like $\ce{H+}$ transfer in acid-base reactions is measured using a $p\ce{H}$-probe, the transfer of $\ce{e-}$ between two atoms can be quantified by measuring the electrical potential between two electrodes. This electrical potential that indirectly quantifies the $\ce{e-}$ activity is called redox potential, $Eh$, and reported in millivolts ($\pu{mV}$) or volts ($\pu{V}$). The transfer of electrons can be visualized using the operation of a galvanic cell, as shown in {numref}`galvanic-cell`.

```{figure} https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Galvanic_cell_with_no_cation_flow.svg/1920px-Galvanic_cell_with_no_cation_flow.svg.png

```

The $Eh$ is correlated to $pe$ as follows:

```{math}
:label: ehrt
Eh = 2.303 \frac{\text{R}T}{F} pe
```
Where, $R = \pu{8.314e-3 kJ mol-1 K-1}$, $T$ is temperature in $\pu{K}$, and $F$ is Faraday's constant and is equal to $\pu{96489 C mol−1}$ or $\pu{96.42 kJ g−1}$. At $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$, Eq. {eq}`ehrt`, is simplified to: 

```{math}
:label: ehpe
Eh = 0.059 pe
```


## $Eh-p\ce{H}$ or Pourbaix Diagrams

The environmental conditions, including $p\ce{H}$ and $Eh$, can have a strong influence on the predominance of any redox sensitive element. Relationships between redox species of different elements vary as a function of $p\ce{H}$ and $Eh$ conditions, a diagram that depicts these relationships can be useful in showing the likelihood of a particular form of a redox sensitive element under any given condition. The value of $Eh-p\ce{H}$ diagrams consists primarily in providing an aid for the interpretation of equilibrium data by permitting the simultaneous representation of many reactions.

Natural waters are often in a highly dynamic state with regard to redox status, rather than in or near equilibrium. Most redox reactions have a tendency to be much slower than acid-base reactions, especially in the absence of suitable biochemical conditions. However, these diagrams can greatly aid in understanding the possible redox patterns in natural waters systems. In {numref}`pourbaix-water`, different $p\ce{H}$ and $Eh$ environments are represented. More positive $Eh$ values represent oxidizing conditions, while more negative $Eh$ values represent reducing conditions. The possible limits of $Eh$ in natural environments are shown in {numref}`pourbaix-water`.

$Eh$ and $p\ce{H}$ conditions for natural waters on Earth's surface at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$.  The upper and lower limits represent oxidation or reduction of water to $\ce{O2(g)}$ or $\ce{H2(g)}$, respectively.

The upper and lower limits of the $Eh-p\ce{H}$ diagram are represented by the oxidation and reduction of water to $\ce{O2(g)}$ and $\ce{H2(g)}$, respectively, as shown in the table below:

| Redox  | Reaction | $K$ values |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|-----------------:|
| Oxidation | $\ce{O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) +  4 e- -> 2 H2O (l)}$ | $10^{83.1}$ |
| Reduction | $\ce{2 H+(aq) + 2 e- -> H2(g)}$              | $1$           |


```{dropdown} Example: Pourbaix diagram for $\ce{As}$ 

The arsenic problem in the Bengal basin is cause by redox transformation of multiple $\ce{As}$ species in soil and groundwater environments. The most common reactions are listed below:

| Reaction                                         | $K$ values       |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------:|
| $\ce{H2AsO4- + 3 H+ + 2 e- -> As(OH)3 + H2O }  $   | $10^{21.68}$ |
| $\ce{HAsO4^2- + 4 H+ + 2 e- -> As(OH)3 + 2 H2O }$  | $10^{28.44}$ |
| $\ce{H3AsO4 + 2 H+ + 2 e- -> As(OH)3 + H2O } $     | $10^{19.44}$ |
| $\ce{HAsO4^2- + 3 H+ + 2 e- -> As(OH)4- + 2 H2O }$ | $10^{19.22}$ |

The resulting Pourbaix diagram is shown in the figure below. If we know the redox conditions prevalent in the soil and groundwater environments, we can easily read from the diagram what As form is likely to predominate under those conditions.

## Microorganisms and Redox Reactions

Redox reactions can be spontaneous as written, however, these reactions occur at a slow rate. Often, microorganisms play an important role, as catalysts, in these reactions. These microorganisms can manufacture or decompose organic matter, produce or consume oxygen, and oxidize or reduce sulfur, iron, nitrogen, and a variety of other substances. They may also influence the rate of a geochemical reaction in which they are producers or consumers of the reactants or products. It is likely that microorganisms contributed significantly to the formation of many types of mineral deposits found in Earth's near surface environments.

Consider the following reaction in which $\ce{N}$ is being oxidized:

$$ \ce{
NH4+ + 2 O2 -> NO3- + H2O + 2 H+
} $$

$\Delta _{rxn}G^\circ = \pu{-266.5 kJ mol-1}$ for this reaction, therefore, this reaction is spontaneous and favored to occur as written. However, $\ce{NH4+}$ is very stable in the environment and the above reaction occurs slowly. This reaction can proceed at a faster rate if the aqueous system contained a certain type of bacteria, *Nitrosomonas* sp. and *Nitrobacter* sp. These bacteria use $\ce{NH4+}$ as nutrient during their metabolism, while facilitating the redox reaction. There are many such reactions that occur in nature.

Note that microorganisms act as catalysts and do not actually participate in the reactions.

## Practice Problems

(1) Determine the oxidation number of each atom in the following compounds and ion: (a) $\ce{SO2}$, (b) $\ce{NaH}$, (c) $\ce{CO3^2-}$, (d) $\ce{N2O5}$.

(2) Rank the following sets of chemical compounds from the most oxidized to the most reduced form:

> (a) $\ce{NH3}$, $\ce{NO3-}$, $\ce{NO2-}$, $\ce{N2}$
>
> (b) $\ce{H2SO4}$, $\ce{SO4^2-}$, $\ce{H2S}$, $\ce{SO2}$, $\ce{SO3}$
>
> (c) $\ce{Cr(s)}$, $\ce{K2Cr2O7}$, $\ce{H2CrO4}$, $\ce{Cr(OH)2-}$

(3) Balance the reactions below. Identify the oxidizing and reducing agents in the balanced reactions.

>(a) Permanganate ion ($\ce{MnO4^-}$) and iodide ($\ce{I-}$) ion react in basic solution to produce manganese(IV) oxide ($\ce{MnO2}$) and molecular iodine ($\ce{I2}$) as follows:
>
 >$$ \ce{
MnO4^- + I- -> MnO2 + I2
} $$
>
>(b) One of the common ways to treat groundwater contaminated with $\ce{Cr(VI)}$ is by using $\ce{Fe}$ minerals, as shown by the following reaction:
>
>$$\ce{
Fe^2+ + Cr2O7^2- -> Fe^3+ + Cr^3+
} $$
>
>(c) $\ce{SO2(g)}$ in air is mainly responsible for the phenomenon of acid rain. Typically, $\ce{SO2}$ generated at the source can be treated by scrubbing the acid rain with a standard permanganate solution as follows:
>
>$$ \ce{
SO2 + MnO4- -> SO4^2- + Mn^2+
} $$
>
>(d) The concentration of a hydrogen peroxide ($\ce{H2O2}$) solution can be conveniently determined by titration against a standardized permanganate ($\ce{MnO4-}$) solution in an acidic medium according to the following unbalanced equation:
>
>$$\ce{
MnO4- + H2O2 -> O2 + Mn^2+
} $$
>
>(e) Organic matter present in soils and natural water has a strong influence on redox processes. In the reaction below, organic matter ($\ce{CH2O}$) is represented in a simplified form:
>
>$$ \ce{
CH2O + NO3- -> HCO3- + N2 + CO2
} $$


(4) Calculate $pe$ in the following examples:

>(a) Calculate $pe$ for natural water at $p\ce{H} = 7.5$ in equilibrium with atmosphere. $P_{\ce{O2}} = \pu{0.21 atm}$ & $K=\pu{e83}$
>
 >$$\ce{
O2 + 4 H+ + 4 -> 2 H2O
} $$
>
>(b) Calculate $pe$ for natural water at $p\ce{H} = 8$ containing $\ce{Mn^2+} = \pu{e-5 M}$ at equilibrium with $\ce{\gamma-MnO2}$ & $K=\pu{e41}$
>
>$$\ce{
\gamma-MnO2 + 4 H+ + 2 -> Mn^2+ + 2 H2O
} $$

(5) Show the $pe-p\ce{H}$ relationships for the following systems:
> (a) Oxidation of $\ce{H2O(l)}$ to $\ce{O2(g)}$.
> 
> (b) Reduction of $\ce{H2O(l)}$ to $\ce{H2(g)}$.

(6) Sulfur is commonly present in coastal environments, such as those near Charleston, SC. Three of the most common forms of $\ce{S}$ in these environments are $\ce{SO4^2-}$, $\ce{S (s)}$, and $\ce{H2S}$. Answer the following questions:

>(a) Write three balanced half-reactions between each pair of $\ce{S}$ species, listed above.
>
> (b) Write the $pe$ expressions for all of the above half-reactions. 
> 
> (c) If $\log K =4.8$ and $36.2$ for fully balanced $\ce{S(s)}-\ce{H2S}$ and $\ce{SO4^2-}-\ce{S(s)}$ half-reactions, respectively, determine $\log K$ for the balanced half-reaction $\ce{SO4^2-}-\ce{H2S}$.
> 
> (d) Of all forms of S present in these coastal environments, which form of $\ce{S}$ will predominate at $p\ce{H} = 4$ and $pe = -3$? Hint: Substitute these values in the 3 $pe$ expressions in part (b).
> 
> (e) If the concentrations of $\ce{S}$ species in each redox couple (see parts (a) and (b) of this problem) are equal, write the new $pe$ expressions.
