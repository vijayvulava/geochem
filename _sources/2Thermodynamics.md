# 2 Thermodynamics

## Introduction

Thermodynamics is a core scientific field that applies to various areas and systems, whether natural or created by humans. It explains and forecasts the behavior of systems interacting with their environment through energy, work, and heat exchanges. The systems examined through this lens can range from microscopic to planetary scales. below are some examples of natural and human systems that can be analyzed using a thermodynamic perspective.

In this example of climate change's impact, scientists apply thermodynamics principles to forecast how different Earth system components respond to the changing climate.

Economists can use thermodynamic principles to explain supply chains and manufacturing processes.

The Earth's interior, including the mantle and plate tectonic theory, can be understood through thermodynamic principles. Studying the Earth from a classical systems perspective enhances the application of thermodynamics.

Scientists and governments rely on "green" solutions to address the climate crisis. However, understanding thermodynamic principles can help us better identify which solutions are more feasible than others.

Equilibrium thermodynamics predicts the concentrations of all species and phases present at the end of a reaction when it reaches equilibrium. In contrast, kinetics examines the rate at which reactions occur. This section will focus on the fundamental concepts of thermodynamics and their applications in environmental geochemistry.

This chapter offers a fundamental understanding of chemical thermodynamics, the foundation for all chemical equilibria. We explain the essential concepts, key functions of the state, and the laws of thermodynamics, demonstrating how these ideas are applied to define the equilibrium conditions for chemical processes. Additionally, we explore how temperature and pressure impact thermodynamic functions and chemical equilibria. Throughout the chapter, I provide examples to illustrate the applications of significant thermodynamic principles and equations.

## Learning Goals

```{admonition} Learning Goals

The main goals for this chapter are to:
1. learn the basic terminology of thermodynamics - including work, energy, systems, and state variables,
2. identify how energy is transferred between systems and their surroundings and 
3. define and apply the laws of thermodynamics and the fundamental thermodynamic properties, including enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy.
