# 3 Chemical Equilibrium

## Introduction

The influence of chemical equilibrium and kinetics on the progression of chemical reactions plays a crucial role in determining the abundance, distribution, and fate of substances in the environment. Understanding the fundamental concepts of chemical equilibrium and kinetics can help us explain and predict the environmental concentrations of both inorganic and organic species in aqueous systems, whether these species occur naturally or have been introduced by humans.

Equilibrium principles help explain Earth's formation and human impacts. Watch the video narrated by renowned environmental scientist David Attenborough.

In the previous chapter, we explored the fundamental principles of thermodynamics, including the laws that govern it. These principles provide insights into why certain reactions occur. In this chapter, we will focus on the terminology associated with chemical reactions and examine the predictive capabilities of thermodynamics in various environmental systems.

## Learning Goals

```{admonition} Learning Goals

The main goals for this chapter are to:
1. learn basic principles of chemical equilibrium
2. describe the law of mass action and the equilibrium constant
3. apply the equilibrium constant to predict outcomes of reactive systems
```
