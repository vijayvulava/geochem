# Environmental Organic Chemistry

## Introduction

Organic chemicals are intimately tied to all aspects of modern societies from consumer goods to pharmaceutical chemicals to household products. More than 9 million carbon-based natural and anthropogenic compounds have been identified. It is no surprise, then, that organic contaminants are ubiquitous in our environments. What happens to an organic compound when it is introduced into the natural environment? The answer depends on the physical and chemical properties of the compound.

## What are organic chemicals?

### Hydrocarbons

Organic compounds are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Other elements, e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous, and the halogens-may also occur in organic compounds. The fundamental building block of organic compounds is the carbon-carbon bond. The bonding between carbon atoms is covalent. Single bonds ($\ce{C-C}$) are formed when one pair of electrons is shared between two carbon atoms. Double bonds ($\ce{C=C}$) involve the sharing of two pairs of electrons, and triple bonds ($\ce{C#C}$) the sharing of three pairs of electrons.

When multiple bonds occur between carbon atoms, the compound is referred to as unsaturated. If there are only single bonds between the carbon atoms, the compound is saturated. These compounds are saturated with $\ce{H}$-atoms.

The carbon atoms are joined together to form chains, branched structures, or rings. A functional group is an atom or a group of atoms that can be attached to the carbon atoms. In most cases, a functional group contains at least one non-carbon atom. Also important is the order in which the functional groups are attached and the geometric position of the attached groups. All of this variability means that the naming of organic molecules is not an easy task.

Hydrocarbons contain only carbon and hydrogen and are the most common group of organic compounds. The major types of hydrocarbons are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic (or aryl) compounds.

In alkanes the C atoms have single bonds and occur as straight or branched chains and as rings. Alkanes, because of their strong single carbon bond, tend to be chemically nonreactive except at high temperatures, such as those found during combustion. Alkanes can undergo substitution reactions in which one or more hydrogens are replaced by atoms of another element. Alkanes are the simplest of the hydrocarbons and has the chemical formula, $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n+2}}$.

Alkenes have a double bond between two of the carbons, and alkynes have a triple bond between two of the carbons. The type of bonding, single versus multiple, affects the reactivity of the molecule.

### Formulas

Molecular formulas give the numbers of each type of atom in the molecule.  For example, the molecular formulas for methane, ethane, and pentane are $\ce{CH4}$, $\ce{C2H6}$, and $\ce{C5H12}$, respectively.

Structural formulas show the orientation of the atoms in a molecule in either two or three dimensions. Condensed structural formulas are used to save space and are written in terms of carbon units. Carbon chains are usually drawn as straight lines in Lewis structures, but Lewis structures are not intended to indicate the geometry of molecules.

## Environmental Behavior of Organic Chemicals

### Aqueous Solubility

This fundamental property refers to the saturated solubility of the organic compound in water and is shown as $C_w^{sat}$ and typical units are $\pu{mol L-1}$ and $\pu{\mu g L-1}$. For typical organic pollutants, $C_w^{sat}$ is usually very low. For example, a relatively high value might be for benzene ($\pu{2.2e-2 mol L-1}$), and a relatively low value might be for decachlorobiphenyl ($\pu{e-10 mol L-1}$). $C_w^{sat}$ changes with temperature but not as much as vapor pressure. There are several thermodynamics-based methods to predict water solubility of organic compounds.

Aqueous solubility of organic chemicals is generally higher for smaller molecules, or for molecules that are more polar and hence can form attractions with the polar water molecules. Many, but not all, ionic compounds (salts) are very water-soluble, as their individual ions can interact strongly with water molecules, whose negative, oxygen-containing ends orient toward cations and whose positive, hydrogen-containing ends orient toward anions. The attractions between water molecules and ions in solution promote movement of ions into solution.

```{table} Aqueous solubility values of selected organic chemicals at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$. Miscible indicates very high solubility.

| Anthracene  | $\pu{2.5e-7}$                       |
```


### Vapor Pressure

Vapor pressure, another chemical-specific property, is defined as the partial pressure of a chemical in a gas phase that is in equilibrium with the pure liquid or solid chemical. Vapor pressure is essentially the solubility of a compound in air. Permanent gases, such as methane, have high vapor pressures; in fact, they have a vapor pressure of $\pu{1 atm}$ or $\pu{760 Torr}$. Some pesticides have medium vapor pressures; for example, hexachlorobenzene has a vapor pressure of about  $\pu{e-7 atm}$. Some compounds, such as decachlorobiphenyl, have vapor pressures so low that they are essentially nonvolatile ( $\pu{e-10 atm}$). For our purposes, the interesting range is  $\pu{e-4 - e-8 atm}$.

```{dropdown} Example: Vapor Pressure
At $\pu{20 ^\circ C}$ a bottle contains both air and pure liquid TCE (trichloroethylene, a common industrial solvent), the partial pressure of TCE vapor in the air-filled neck of the bottle (the headspace) will be approximately $\pu{0.08 atm}$. The ideal gas law is used to convert the vapor pressure into the corresponding concentration (expressed in moles of vapor per volume), 

$$
\frac{n}{V}=\frac{P}{\text{R}T}
$$

where $n$ is the number of moles of the chemical, $V$ is the volume, $P$ is the vapor pressure, $R$ is the gas constant ($\pu{0.0821 L atm mol−1 K-1}$), and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Thus, a partial pressure of $\pu{0.08 atm}$ of TCE corresponds to a concentration of approximately $\pu{0.003 mg L−1}$.

```

The term volatility is often used to qualitatively describe a chemical's vapor pressure. Although there are no universally agreed-upon cutoffs, chemicals described as volatile typically have vapor pressures exceeding $\pu{1 atm}$ at the boiling point of water ($\pu{100 ^\circ C}$). Examples of volatile chemicals include solvents, such as TCE, and hydrocarbons present in gasoline, such as benzene. Semivolatile chemicals typically have vapor pressures lower than $\pu{1 atm}$ at $\pu{100 ^\circ C}$ but nevertheless can volatilize significantly at environmental temperatures. Examples include naphthalene (found in mothballs) and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Chemicals whose vapor pressures are negligible are often called nonvolatile; examples include most salts. Vapor pressures are temperature dependent.

### Partitioning into Phases

Environmental distribution of organic compounds can be studies by looking at their equilibrium partitioning between environmental phases, which include air, water, soil, and biota. Taking these phases pairwise, we can define the various physical and chemical properties that control the partition coefficients between these phases:
1. Air-water: vapor pressure and water solubility
2. Water-soil: adsorption and water solubility
3. Soil-air: adsorption and vapor pressure
4. All phases - biota: fat solubility or "lipophilicity"

Partitioning between the air and water depends on a compound's vapor pressure and water solubility. A highly soluble compound with low vapor pressure, such as sodium chloride, would not move across the air-water interface and would stay almost completely in the water phase; a very volatile compound, such as methane, would easily move out of the water phase and over time its concentration in the water would approach zero.

Partitioning between air and soil or sediment also depends on a compound's tendency to adsorb to particles and its vapor pressure. For example, DDT has a low vapor pressure and a high tendency to adsorb to particles; therefore, it is only slowly released from soils and sediments to the air.

Lastly, partitioning and accumulation of pollutants into biota depends on all of these factors, especially vapor pressure and water solubility, but it is largely dependent on the compound's solubility in the fat of the organism. The latter has a special name: ***lipophilicity***, which simply means *fat loving*. It might also be called ***hydrophobicity*** (*water fearing*), but the most common term for this property is lipophilicity - note the spelling of this word.

Let's consider a system in which two bulk phases, 1 and 2 (e.g., air and water), are in contact with each other at a given temperature and pressure. We assume that the two phases are in equilibrium with each other with respect to the amounts of all chemical species present in each. We now introduce a very small amount of a given organic compound $i$ into *Phase 1* (i.e., the properties of both bulk phases are not significantly influenced by the introduction of the compound). After a short time, some molecules of compound *i* will have been transferred from *Phase 1* (reactant) to *Phase 2* (product). This partitioning can be simply represented in a reaction form as follows:

$$
\ce{$i$ in Phase 1 <=> $i$ in Phase 2}
$$

The equilibrium situation can thus be described by an equilibrium partition constant, $K_p$, which we define as:

```{math}
:label: parti
K_p = \frac{C_{i,2}}{C_{i,1}}
```
Because we have chosen $i$ in Phase 2 as the "product," the abundance of $i$ in Phase 2 is in the numerator of Eq. {eq}`parti`. For practical purposes, we define a constant expressed as a ratio of concentrations rather than activities. Finally, we consider only situations in which the compound is present as a solute, that is, at low concentrations such that it does not significantly affect the properties of the bulk phase.

### Air-Water Partitioning

Partitioning between air and water is represented using the Henry's law constant ($K_H$ or $H$). $K_H$ is the ratio of a compound's water solubility ($C_w^{sat}$) to its partial pressure above that water sample. 

```{math}
:label: khorg
K_H = \frac{C_\text{Air}}{C_{\ce{H2O}}}
```
When concentration of the compound is expressed in partial pressures (atm) and $C_w^{sat}$ is expressed in , then $K_H$ units reflect these concentration units. When both $C_{Air}$ and $C_w^{sat}$ have same units, $K_H$ becomes dimensionless.


```{dropdown} Example: Air-Water Partitioning 

Benzene (a BTEX hydrocarbon) is released during an industrial accident and enters the groundwater system. The average concentration of benzene in the water is $\pu{1000 mg L−1}$ (same as ppm). If the water is in contact with air, calculate the concentration of benzene in the air in . $K_H$ for benzene is $0.22849$.

**Answer**:
First convert $\pu{1000 mg L−1}$ to $\pu{mol L-1}$. Assume that $\pu{1 kg}$ of water is equivalent to a volume of $\pu{1 L}$. The molecular weight of benzene ($\ce{C6H6}$) is 78.

$$\frac{\pu{1000 mg L-1} \times \pu{e-3 mg g-1}}{\pu{78g mol-1}} = \pu{1.28e-2 mol L-1}$$

Substitute this concentration in Eq. {eq}`khorg`, we get

$$\begin{aligned}
K_H &= \frac{C_{Air}}{C_{\ce{H2O}}}\\
0.22849 &= \frac{C_{Air}}{\pu{1.28e-2 mol L-1}}\\
\therefore C_{Air} &= \pu{2.92e-3 mol L-1}
\end{aligned}$$
```


### Water-Organics Partitioning

We use partition constants or coefficients to quantify distribution of organic chemicals in different phases (see Eq. {eq}`parti`. They are defined as the ratio of the concentration of an organic compound in two phases that are in equilibrium with each other. 
```{math}
:label: korg-h2o
K = \frac{C_\text{Organics}}{C_{\ce{H2O}}}
```

Note that the denominator concentration will be something less than $C_w^{sat}$. A high value of $K$ suggests that the compound is not very water soluble but is more soluble in organic solvents. In this case, the compound is said to be *lipophilic* (or fat soluble).

To simulate lipids (fats) in biota, pharmacologists long ago selected a model compound: n-octanol. Thus, the partition coefficient that best describes lipophilicity is the octanol-water partition coefficient, usually given the symbol $K_{ow}$. The interesting values of $K_{ow}$ are usually in the $\pu{e2 - e7}$ range; hence, it is convenient to use the logarithm of $K_{ow}$. Clearly $K_{ow}$ is related to $C_w^{sat}$; high water solubility implies a low $K_{ow}$. An empirical relationship between these two parameters:

```{math}
:label: logkow
\log K_{ow} = - 0.86 \log C_w^{sat} + 0.32
```
 Note that $C_w^{sat}$ is in . High $\log K_{ow}$ values imply that the organic compound is *lipophilic*. If one knows the $\log K_{ow}$ value of a given compound, it is possible to calculate the $\log K_{ow}$ value of related compounds.

### Water-Solid Partitioning

Adsorption refers to the collection of organic compounds on the surfaces of particles, such as soil, suspended sediment, and aerosols. Most of these particles are covered with a layer of organic material; thus, the adsorption results from the attraction of two organic materials for one another. Adsorption is measured by the solid-water distribution coefficient ($K_d$), which is the ratio of the concentration of the compound on the solid to its concentration in the water surrounding the solid: 

```{math}
:label: kd
K_d = \frac{C_\text{Solid}}{C_{\ce{H2O}}}
```

The concentration on the solid has units of $\pu{mol kg−1}$, and the concentration in the water is ; hence, $K_d$ has units of $\pu{L kg−1}$. Is we assume a a solid density of $\pu{1 kg L-1}$, these units are often ignored. $K_d$ will often depend on how much of the total mass of the particle is organic material; thus, $K_d$ can be corrected by the fraction of organic material ($f_{om}$) in the particles to give the following expression.

```{math}
:label: kom
K_{om} = \frac{K_d}{f_{om}}
```
Note that $f_{om}$ is a fraction and is always less than $1$ and often less than $0.1$. Because the partitioning is from the water to the organic material on the particle, it should come as no surprise that $K_{om}$ is empirically related to $K_{ow}$ and to the water solubility: 

```{math}
:label: kom-csat

\begin{aligned}
    \log K_{om} &= 0.82 \log K_{ow} + 0.14\\
    &= -0.75 \log C_w^{sat} + 0.44 
\end{aligned}
```

```{dropdown} Example: Adsorption 

It was found that the adsorption of napthalene onto sedimentary particles followed a linear relationship, with $K_d = \pu{137 L kg−1}$. If the napthalene concentration in the groundwater was $\pu{3.2 mg L−1}$, calculate the concentration of napthalene adsorbed onto the sedimentary particles in the aquifer.

**Answer**:
Substitute given data in Eq. {eq}`kd` as follows. 

$$\begin{aligned}
K_d &= \frac{C_{Solid}}{C_{\ce{H2O}}}\\
\pu{137 L kg-1} &= \frac{C_{Solid}}{\pu{3.2 mg L-1}}\\
C_{Solid} &= \pu{438 mg kg-1}
\end{aligned}$$

```


### Bioaccumulation

Since many organic pollutants are lipophilic, it is not surprising that they are found in organisms and biota that are exposed to them. Most organic pollutants tend to accumulate in biota. The simplest case of an animal in equilibrium with its surroundings is a fish. In this case, we can define a partition coefficient for the concentration of some organic compound in the fish relative to the concentration of that compound in the water in which the fish lives: 

```{math}
:label: kbiol
K_B = \frac{C_\text{Fish}}{C_{\ce{H2O}}}
```
 where $C_{fish}$ is the concentration of some pollutant in the whole fish, usually in units of $\pu{\mu g g−1}$ of wet weight of fish, and $C_{\ce{H2O}}$ is the concentration of the same pollutant in the surrounding water, usually in units of $\pu{\mu g cm−3}$ of water. The partition coefficient $K_B$ is sometimes called the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and has no units. Because octanol was selected to simulate animal lipids, $K_B$ is related to $K_{ow}$ as shown in the empirical relationship below: 

```{math}
:label: kbkow
K_B = \log K_{ow} - 1.32
```

$K_B$ is higher for animals that feed on fish. E.g., dolphins and other higher level predators can have many times greater $K_B$.

```{dropdown} Example: Bioaccumulation 

A covered soup bowl contains $\pu{1 L}$ of a very dilute, tepid soup (at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$), $\pu{1 L}$ of air, and a floating blob of fat with a volume of $\pu{1 mL}$. The soup also contains $\pu{1 mg}$ of naphthalene. The $\log K_{ow}$ for naphthalene is $3.36$ and its unitless Henry's law constant $0.0174$.

Assuming everything is at equilibrium, estimate the amount of naphthalene you would ingest if you were to eat only the fat blob.

**Answer**:
First set up the mass balance equation: 

$$\begin{aligned}
M_{total} = \pu{1 mg} &= M_{\ce{H2O}} + M_{Air} + M_{Fat}  \\
&= C_{\ce{H2O}}V_{\ce{H2O}} + C_{Air}V_{Air} + C_{Fat}V_{Fat} \\
&= C_{\ce{H2O}}(\pu{1 L}) + C_{Air}(\pu{1 L}) + C_{Fat}(\pu{e-3 L})
\end{aligned}$$ 

We need to make this into an equation with only one unknown to solve for $M_{Fat}$

Now, let's rearrange the partitioning coefficients: 

$$\begin{aligned}
K_{ow}  &= \frac{C_{Fat}}{C_{\ce{H2O}}} \\
\text{Or,} \quad    C_{\ce{H2O}} &= \frac{C_{Fat}}{K_{ow}} 
\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
K_H &= \frac{C_{Air}}{C_{\ce{H2O}}}  \\
\text{Or,}\quad C_{Air} &= K_H (C_{\ce{H2O}}) 
\end{aligned}$$

Combining the above two expressions, we get

$$
C_{Air} = K_H \left(\frac{C_{Fat}}{K_{ow}} \right) 
$$

Substitute $C_{\ce{H2O}}$ and $C_{Air}$ expressions into the $M_{total}$ expression

$$\begin{aligned}
M_{total}   &= \left(\frac{C_{Fat}}{K_{ow}}\right) (\pu{1 L}) + K_H \left(\frac{C_{Fat}}{K_{ow}} \right)(\pu{1 L}) + C_{Fat}(\pu{e-3 L})  \\
&= (C_{Fat})\left( \frac{1}{K_{ow}} + \frac{K_H}{K_{ow}} + \pu{e-3}\right)\\
&= (C_{Fat}) \left( \frac{1}{10^{3.36}} + \frac{0.0174}{10^{3.36}} + \pu{e-3}\right)\\
&=  (C_{Fat})(\pu{0.00144 L})
\end{aligned}$$

Simplify and calculate $C_{Fat}$ and $M_{Fat}$ 

$$\begin{aligned}
M_{total}   &=  (C_{Fat})(\pu{0.00144 L})\\
C_{Fat} &= \frac{M_{total}}{\pu{0.00144 L}} = \frac{\pu{1 mg}}{\pu{0.00144 L}}\\
& = \pu{693 mg L-1}\\
M_{Fat} &= C_{Fat}\times V_{Fat} = \pu{693 mg L-1}\times \pu{e-3 L}\\
&= \pu{0.693 mg} 
\end{aligned}$$

```


```{dropdown} Example: Partitioning 

A stream is contaminated with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TCB) and has 1,2,4-TCB concentration of $\pu{2.3 \mu g L-1}$. The molecular weight of this compound is $\pu{181.5 g mol−1}$, and its $\log K_{ow}$ (at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$) is $4.04$. Estimate the maximum concentration of 1,2,4-TCB in rainbow trout swimming in water.

**Answer**:
First, let's calculate $K_B$ using $K_{ow}$ using Eq. {eq}`kbkow`.

$$\begin{aligned}
\log K_B &= \log K_{ow} - 1.32\\
&= 4.04-1.32 = 2.72\\
K_B = 10^{2.72} = 524.8
\end{aligned}$$ 

Now, apply this value to the $K_B$ expression in Eq. {eq}`kbiol`: 

$$\begin{aligned}
K_B &= \frac{C_{fish}}{C_{\ce{H2O}}}\\
524.8 &= \frac{C_{fish}}{\pu{2.3 \mu g L-1}}\\
C_{fish} &= \pu{1207 \mu g L-1}
\end{aligned}$$

### Degradation

An organic chemical's degradation in the air, water, and solids is determined by its tendency to be destroyed through direct and indirect photolysis, microbial action, redox processes, and many other reactions. For those chemicals predominantly dissolved in water or adsorbed to soil and sediment, chemical or biochemical transformations may also be important fate processes, each with their characteristic rate constant.

See Kinetics chapter for a recap on how degradation problems can be solved.

## Practice Problems

(1) If $K_H$ is  $\pu{29.51 atm L mol-1}$ for $\ce{CO2}$ and the atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ concentration is $\pu{0.004 atm}$, what is $\ce{CO2}$ concentration in water at equilibrium?

(2) m-Xylene enters the groundwater system. The average concentration of m-Xylene in the groundwater is $\pu{100 ppm}$.

(3) It was determined that the adsorption of toluene onto sedimentary particles followed a linear relationship, with $K_d$ = $\pu{9.9 L kg−1}$.

(5) Assume an organic contaminant is introduced into an aquifer. Right after the spill the concentration of the organic contaminant is $\pu{12 mg L−1}$.

Assuming that this is a first-order reaction, what is the half-life for this particular organic contaminant? **Answer**: $\pu{5.6 d}$

(6) Lindane is considered to be a persistent organic pollutant (POP) in the environment. It has $\log K_H = 3.94$ and $\log K_{ow} = 3.78$ and first order rate constants for its loss from air, water, and soil/sediment are $\pu{0.1 d-1}$, $\pu{0.01 d-1}$, and $\pu{0.0006 d-1}$, respectively. Estimate the half-life of lindane loss from air, water, and soil/sediment.
