# Acids and Bases

## Introduction

An acid-base reaction is one in which a hydrogen ion, $\ce{H+}$, is transferred from one chemical species to another. Such reactions are of central importance to numerous natural and anthropogenic processes, ranging from the chemical transformations that take place within human bodies, lakes and oceans, to industrial-scale production of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and other substances essential to society.

In this chapter we explore the basic geochemistry of acid-base reactions.  Below are some examples of where acids and bases are encountered in natural and anthropogenic environments.

### Atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ and $p\ce{H}$ in Natural Water

Pure water containing no dissolved ions or gases is considered to be "neutral" or neither acidic not basic. However, rainwater is not pure water since it comes in contact with Earth's atmosphere which contains many gases. While atmospheric gases such as and are relatively nonreactive in water, other gases such as are very reactive. reacts with water to form carbonic acid ($\ce{H2CO3}$), which makes rainwater acidic.

The sequence of $\ce{CO2(g)}$-caused rainwater acidification reactions is as follows. These important reactions will be explored further in this chapter.

$$
\begin{align*}
	\ce{
		CO2 (g) &<=>[H2O (l)] CO2 (aq)\\
		CO2 (aq) + H2O (l) &<=> H2CO3 (aq) \\
		H2CO3(aq) &<=> H+ (aq) + HCO3- (aq) \\
		HCO3- (aq) &<=> H+ (aq) + CO3^2- (aq) 
	}
\end{align*}
$$
The produced $\ce{H+}$ are the source of acidity to rainwater. The presence of $\ce{H+}$ typically lowers $p\ce{H}$ of typical rainwaters to $\approx 5.7$. As we learned from thermodynamic principles, increasing $\ce{CO2(g)}$ concentrations in these sequence of reactions favors formation of more  $\ce{H+}$ or the increase in acidity of water. This increase in acidity in ocean water has been attributed to suppressing of the carbonate ion ($\ce{CO3^2-}$) concentrations - an ion that is critical for marine calcifying organisms such as corals. For more information, see [Ocean Acidification | National Climate Assessment (globalchange.gov)](https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/ocean-acidification). Thermodynamic principles predict that lowering will also lower the formation acidity in water.

### Acid Rain

Human activities - mainly fossil fuel-based power generation and automobile emissions - are the main cause of acid rain. Fossil fuels typically contain $\pu{1-3 \%}$ of sulfur along with nitrogen and other minerals. Coal and fuel combustion releases large concentrations of nitrogen oxides ($\ce{NO_x (g)}$, a combination of $\ce{NO (g)}$ and $\ce{NO2 (g)}$) and sulfur dioxide ($\ce{SO2}$) into the atmosphere. These gases mix and react with rainwater, $\ce{O2 (g)}$, and other chemicals to form more acidic pollutants, known as acid rain. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides dissolve very easily in water and can be carried very far by the wind.

The sequence of $\ce{SO2(g)}$-caused rainwater acidification reactions is as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
	\ce{
		2 SO2 (g) + O2 (g) &-> 2 SO3 (g)\\
		SO3 (g) + H2O (l) &-> H2SO4 (aq)\\
		H2SO4 (aq) &-> H+ (aq) + HSO4^- (aq)&
	}
\end{align*}
$$

Sequence of $\ce{NO_x}$-caused rainwater acidification reactions:

$$
\begin{align*}
	\ce{
		2 NO (g) + O2 (g) &-> 2 NO2 (g)\\
		2 NO2 (g)  + H2O (l) &-> HNO2 (aq) + HNO3 (aq)\\
		HNO3 (l) &-> H+ (aq) + NO3- (aq)
	}
\end{align*}
$$

The release of $\ce{H+}$ into water is the cause of increased acidity in water. These reactions produce more acid than dissolution of $\ce{CO2(g)}$ in water causing drop of $p\ce{H}$ to alarming levels in affected areas.

Extraction of metals from ore materials (typically oxides or sulfides of metals) usually involves heating the ore at high temperatures to separate the base metal from the remaining elements. This process is called smelting and has been probably been applied by human civilizations as far back as 5500 BCE. Smelting of sulfide minerals ($\ce{CuS}$, $\ce{PbS}$, $\ce{FeS2}$, etc.) releases into the atmosphere causing acid rain, if the emissions are not controlled (e.g., see {numref}`ducktown`)

## What are Acids and Bases?

### Arrhenius Acids and Bases

The most common definition of an acid is a substance that ionizes in water to produce $\ce{H+}$ (proton) (or more correctly, $\ce{H3O+}$ hydronium ions), and a base is a substance that ionizes (or dissociates, in the case of an ionic base) in water to produce $\ce{OH-}$ (hydroxide). This definition is attributed to Svante Arrhenius ([Svante Arrhenius - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius)).

```{figure} https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20221109.213337/resources/a2429091fdcae9cd8629f7300bc98515efc7d3e2

When hydrogen chloride ($\ce{HCl}$) gas dissolves in water, (a) it reacts as an acid, transferring protons to water molecules to yield (b) hydronium $\ce{H3O+}$ ions (and solvated chloride ions). Image source: [7.2 Classifying Chemical Reactions - Chemistry: Atoms First | OpenStax](https://openstax.org/books/chemistry-atoms-first/pages/7-2-classifying-chemical-reactions)
```

As shown in {numref}`arrhenius-acid`, $\ce{HCl}$ reaction with water is essentially $\pu{100 \%}$ efficient. Because every $\ce{HCl}$ molecule that dissolves in water undergoes this reaction, such acids are called ***strong acids***. 

$$
\ce{HCl(aq) + H2O(aq)⟶ Cl−(aq) + H3O+(aq)}
$$

A far greater number of compounds behave as ***weak acids*** and only partially react with water, leaving a large majority of dissolved molecules in their original form and generating a relatively small amount of hydronium ions. Weak acids are more commonly encountered in nature, being the substances partly responsible for the tangy taste of citrus fruits, the stinging sensation of insect bites, and the unpleasant smells associated with body odor. A familiar example of a weak acid is acetic acid ($\ce{CH3COOH}$), the main ingredient in vinegars:

$$
\ce{
CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ CH3COO− (aq) + H3O+(aq)
}
$$

When dissolved in water under typical conditions, only about $\pu{1 \%}$ of acetic acid molecules are present in the ionized form, $\ce{CH3COO−}$. (The use of a double-arrow in the reaction above denotes the partial reaction aspect of this process, a concept addressed in the chapter on chemical equilibrium.)

A base is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield $\ce{OH-}$. The most common bases are ionic compounds composed of alkali or alkaline earth metal cations (groups 1 and 2) combined with the $\ce{OH-}$ - for example, $\ce{NaOH}$ and $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$. When these compounds dissolve in water, $\ce{OH-}$ are released directly into the solution. These bases, along with other hydroxides that completely dissociate in water, are considered ***strong bases***. Consider as an example the dissolution of lye (sodium hydroxide) in water:

$$\ce{
NaOH(s) ⟶ Na+(aq) + OH−(aq)
}
$$

This reaction confirms that $\ce{NaOH}$ is a base. Since the dissociation process is essentially complete when ionic compounds dissolve in water under typical conditions, NaOH and other ionic hydroxides are all classified as strong bases.

Unlike ionic hydroxides, some compounds produce $\ce{OH-}$ when dissolved by chemically reacting with water molecules. In all cases, these compounds react only partially and so are classified as ***weak bases***. These types of compounds are also abundant in nature and important commodities in various technologies. For example, global production of the weak base ammonia is typically well over $\pu{100 tons}$ annually, being widely used as an agricultural fertilizer, a raw material for chemical synthesis of other compounds, and an active ingredient in household cleaners. When dissolved in water, ammonia reacts partially to yield $\ce{OH-}$, as shown here:

$$
\ce{
NH3(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH−(aq)
}$$

This is, by definition, an acid-base reaction, in this case involving the transfer of $\ce{H+}$ from water molecules to ammonia molecules. Under typical conditions, only about $\pu{1 \%}$ of the dissolved ammonia is present as $\ce{NH4+}$ ions.

```{dropdown} Example: Arrhenius acids and bases 

Identify the Arrhenius acids and bases in the reactions below:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{HCl &-> H+ + Cl- \\
HNO3 &-> H+ + NO3- \\
NaOH &-> Na+ + OH- \\
Ca(OH)2 &-> Ca^2+ + 2 OH-}
\end{align*}
$$

> First two reactions are examples of an Arrhenius acid, while the third and fourth reactions are examples of an Arrhenius base.
``` 

### Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases

The Arrhenius definition for acids and bases in the previous section is a bit restrictive. For example, this definition does not cover bases that do not produce $\ce{OH-}$ (e.g., $\ce{NH3}$ in the last reaction). Johannes Brønsted ([Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Nicolaus_Br%C3%B8nsted)) and Thomas Martin Lowry ([Martin Lowry - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lowry)) improved the standard definition as follows: Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton ($\ce{H+}$) donor, and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a $\ce{H+}$ acceptor.

```{dropdown} Example: Brønsted acids and bases 

Identify the Brønsted acids and bases in the reactions below:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{HF &<=> H+ + F-\\
NH3 + H2O &<=> NH4+ + OH-}
\end{align*}
$$

> The first example below is both an Arrhenius and Brønsted acid as is donated. The second example is also both an Arrhenius and Brønsted base because it produces a $\ce{OH-}$ and accepts a $\ce{H+}$ (to become $\ce{NH4+}$).
```

The reactions below show the same reaction but it is important to recognize that $\ce{H+}$ does not exist as an isolated species in solution. Rather, it is hydrated just as other aqueous ions are. The proton, being positively charged, is strongly attracted to the partial negative charge ($\delta -$) on the oxygen atom in a water molecule and forms the **hydronium ion,** $\ce{H3O+}$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{HF &<=> H+ + F-\\
HF + H2O &<=> H3O+ + F-}
\end{align*}
$$

Both and are used interchangeably throughout the text, but they refer to the same aqueous species.

Note that acids and bases that donate one are called monoprotic acid or base (most examples shown above) and those that can donate or accept multiple and are referred to as multiprotic or polyprotic acids and bases. Examples of polyprotic acids and bases include $\ce{H2SO4}$ (sulfuric acid), $\ce{H3PO4}$ (phosphoric acid), $\ce{Ba(OH)2}$ (barium hydroxide), etc.

When a Brønsted-Lowry acid donates a $\ce{H+}$, what remains of the acid is known as a conjugate base. For example, in the ionization of $\ce{HCl}$ in water,

$$\ce{
HCl + H2O -> H3O+ + Cl-
}$$

$\ce{HCl}$ is the Brønsted-Lowry acid, producing a $\ce{Cl-}$, the conjugate base. In other words $\ce{HCl-Cl-}$ are called conjugate acid-base pair.

When a Brønsted-Lowry base accepts a $\ce{H+}$, the newly formed protonated species is known as a conjugate acid. For example, $\ce{NH3}$ ionizes in water,

$$\ce{
NH3 + H2O <=> NH4+ + OH-
}$$

$\ce{NH3}$ accepts a $\ce{H+}$ from water to become the ammonium ion ($\ce{NH4+}$). $\ce{NH4+}$ is the conjugate acid of $\ce{NH3}$.

### Acid-Base Properties of Water

Water is considered an *universal solvent* due to it's ubiquity and importance for all biological, environmental, and surficial geological processes. In addition, most environmental acid-base chemistry we encounter takes place in aqueous solution. Water has the ability to act as either a Brønsted-Lowry acid (as in the ionization of $\ce{HCl}$) or a Brønsted-Lowry base (as in the ionization of $\ce{NH3}$). A species that can behave either as a Brønsted-Lowry acid or a Brønsted-Lowry base is called amphoteric. Water is also a very weak electrolyte, but it does undergo ionization to a small extent:

$$\ce{
H2O <=> H+ + OH-
}$$

This reaction is known as the autoionization of water. Because we can represent the aqueous proton as either $\ce{H+}$ or $\ce{H3O+}$, we can also write the autoionization of water as

$$\ce{
2 H2O <=> H3O+ + OH-
}$$

where one $\ce{H2O}$ acts as an acid and the other acts as a base. As indicated by the $\rightleftharpoons$ in the reaction above, this is an equilibrium reaction. We can use basic thermodynamic principles to estimate the $K_c$ for this reaction. The equilibrium expression for above reactions can be written as

```{math}
:label: kw

K_c = \dfrac{\{\ce{H3O+}\}\{\ce{OH-}\}}{\{\ce{H2O}\}^2} = \{\ce{H3O+}\}\{\ce{OH-}\} =  K_w
```

Note that $\{\ce{H2O}\}= 1$ by convention. Since this an important equilibrium reaction that is encountered frequently in environmental systems, we give $K_c$ a special subscript $w$ to indicate autoionization equilibrium constant of water, $K_w$.

Using thermodynamic data, we can calculate $K_w$ at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$ as 

```{math}
:label: kw2

K_w =  \{\ce{H3O+}\}\{\ce{OH-}\} =  \pu{e-14}
```

In pure water, autoionization is the only source of $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$, and the stoichiometry of the reaction tells us that their concentrations are equal. At $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$, 

$$\{\ce{H3O+}\} = \{\ce{OH-}\} =  \pu{1.0e-7}$$

````{margin}
Concentrations of $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ are usually so low in environmental systems compared with the remainder of ions, that their activities are practically equal to their concentrations.
````

Although $K_w$  is constant, the individual concentrations of $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ can be influenced by the addition of an acid or a base. The relative amounts of $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ determine whether a solution is neutral, acidic, or basic as summarized in {numref}`h3o-oh`

```{table} Relative amounts of $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ in aqueous solutions.
:name: h3o-oh
| Acid or Base | $\ce{H3O+}$ vs $\ce{OH-}$  |
|---|---|
| Acid | $\{\ce{H3O+}\} > \{\ce{OH-}\}$ |
| Neutral | $\{\ce{H3O+}\} = \{\ce{OH-}\}$ |
| Base | $\{\ce{H3O+}\} < \{\ce{OH-}\}$ |

```


```{dropdown} Example: Calculating $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$

$\{\ce{H3O+}\} = \pu{0.1 M}$ in stomach acid. Let's calculate the $\ce{OH-}$ in stomach acid at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$. Let's substitute $\ce{H3O+}$ into Eq. {eq}`kw2`.

$$\begin{aligned}
        \pu{1e-14} &=  \{\ce{H3O+}\}\{\ce{OH-}\} =  (0.1)\{\ce{OH-}\}\\
        \text{or,}\, \{\ce{OH-}\} &= \frac{\pu{1e-14}}{0.1} =\pu{1.0e-13 M}
    \end{aligned}$$
```


###  $p\ce{H}$ and $p\ce{OH}$

The acidity of an aqueous solution depends on $\{\ce{H3O+}\}$. This concentration can range over many orders of magnitude, which can make reporting the numbers cumbersome. To describe the acidity of a solution, rather than report the molar concentration of $\ce{H3O+}$, we typically use the more convenient  scale. The $p\ce{H}$ of a solution is defined as the negative base-10 logarithm of the $[\ce{H3O+}]$ (in $\pu{mol L-1}$ or $\pu{M}$). 

```{math}
:label: ph

p\ce{H} = -\log_{10}[\ce{H3O+}]
```

$p\ce{H}$ of a solution is dimensionless, units of concentration are removed before applying the logarithm. Conversely, when concentration of solutions are calculated from $p\ce{H}$, the original units are added back.

```{dropdown} Example: Calculating $p\ce{H}$

Let's calculate the $p\ce{H}$ of pure water at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$. From previous section we know that $\{\ce{H3O+}\} =  \pu{1e-7}{M}$. Therefore,

$$p\ce{H} = -\log_{10}(\pu{1e-7}) = 7.0
$$

```

Our understanding of $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ in water can be summarized as shown in {numref}`h3o-oh-ph`.
```{table} Relative amounts of $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ and the $p\ce{H}$ in aqueous solutions.
:name: h3o-oh-ph
| Acid or Base | $\ce{H3O+}$ vs $\ce{OH-}$  | $p\ce{H}$ range |
|---|---| --- |
| Acid | $\{\ce{H3O+}\} > \{\ce{OH-}\}$ | $p\ce{H} < 7$ |
| Neutral | $\{\ce{H3O+}\} = \{\ce{OH-}\}$ | $p\ce{H} = 7$ |
| Base | $\{\ce{H3O+}\} < \{\ce{OH-}\}$ | $p\ce{H} > 7$ |

```

We can also determine the from  using the "antilog" or "inverse log" of  as shown below: 

```{math}
:label: h3o_conc

[\ce{H3O+}] = 10^{-p\ce{H}}
```

Let's look at Eq. {eq}`kw2` again and apply negative logarithm to both sides of that equation. 

```{math}
:label: phpoh

\begin{aligned}
-\log_{10}(\{\ce{H3O+}\}\{\ce{OH-}\}) &=  -\log_{10}(\pu{1.0e-14}) \\
-\log_{10}(\{\ce{H3O+}\}) - \log_{10}(\{\ce{OH-}\}) &= 14 \\
p\ce{H} + p\ce{OH} &= 14
\end{aligned}
```

Eq. {eq}`phpoh` gives us another way to express $\{\ce{H3O+}\}$ and $\{\ce{OH-}\}$  in water.

## Strength of Acids and Bases

Strength of acids and bases are measured by their tendency to ionize. Let's consider a hypothetical strong acid $\ce{HX}$ that readily ionizes in water.

$$\ce{
HX ->[H2O] H+ + X-
}$$

In the above case, weak $\ce{H-X}$ bonds within the molecular structure can result in strong ionization and vice versa. This bond strength is referred to as bond enthalpy. Another factor that impacts strength of acids is polarity in the $\ce{H-X}$ bond or difference in electronegativity in the main bond. When the above $\ce{H-X}$ is highly polarized, $\ce{HX}$ tends to break up into $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{X-}$. Therefore, high degree of polarity results in stronger acids (or bases).

[The strengths and weaknesses of acids and bases - TED-Ed](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-acids-and-bases-george-zaidan-and-charles-morton)

<div class="container">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DupXDD87oHc" 
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="video"></iframe>
</div>

In general, hydrohalic acids (acids with halide conjugate base) are strong with the exception of $\ce{HF}$. The strength is these acids are as follows: 

$$\ce{HF} \ll \ce{HCl} < \ce{HBr} < \ce{HI}$$

Strength of oxoacids (acids that contain $\ce{H}$, $\ce{O}$, and a central, nonmetal atom) increases with the electronegativity of central nonmetal atom. For example, since $\ce{Cl}$ is more electronegative than $\ce{Br}$, therefore the strength of these acids are:

$$\ce{HClO3} > \ce{HBrO3}$$
When oxoacids have same central atom, but different number of $\ce{O}$ atoms, the strength of the acid is directly proportional to number of $\ce{O}$ atoms present (or directly proportional to oxidation state of central atom). For example,

$$\ce{HClO4} > \ce{HClO3} > \ce{HClO2} > \ce{HClO}$$

There are only a few strong acids and include: $\ce{HCl}$, $\ce{HBr}$, $\ce{HI}$, $\ce{HNO3}$, $\ce{HClO3}$ (chloric acid), $\ce{HClO4}$ (perchloric acid), and $\ce{H2SO4}$. Because ionization of these strong acids in water is $\pu{100 \%}$ complete, $\{\ce{H3O+}\}$ is same as initial concentration of the acid.

```{dropdown} Example: $p\ce{H}$ of strong acids 

Calculate the $p\ce{H}$ of $\pu{0.035 M}$ $\ce{HI}$ at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$. 

Because $\ce{HI}$ is a strong acid, it produces $\pu{0.035 M}$ of $\ce{H3O+}$. Therefore, $p\ce{H}= -\log_{10}(0.035) = 1.46$.
```

Hydroxides of alkali metals (Group 1 - e.g., $\ce{LiOH}$, $\ce{NaOH}$, $\ce{KOH}$, $\ce{RbOH}$, $\ce{CsOH}$) and alkaline earth metals (Group 2 - e.g., $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$, $\ce{Mg(OH)2}$, and $\ce{Ba(OH)2}$) are strong bases.

```{dropdown} Example: $p\ce{H}$ of strong bases
 
Let's calculate $p\ce{H}$ of $\pu{0.018 M}$  NaOH at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$. Because $\ce{NaOH}$ is a strong base, it produces $\pu{0.018 M}$ of $\ce{OH-}$. There are two ways we can calculate $p\ce{H}$.

Approach 1. Substitute $\{\ce{OH-}\}$ in Eq. {eq}`kw2`:

$$\begin{aligned}
\{\ce{H3O+}\}\{\ce{OH-}\} &=  \pu{1.0e-14}\\
\{\ce{H3O+}\} &= \frac{\pu{1.0e-14}}{\{\ce{OH-}\}} \\
&= \frac{\pu{1.0e-14}}{(0.018)} = \pu{5.56e-13}\\
p\ce{H} &= -\log(\pu{5.56e-13}) =12.25
\end{aligned}$$

Approach 2: Calculate $p\ce{OH}$ from $\{\ce{OH-}\}$ and substitute this value in Eq. {eq}`phpoh`: 

$$\begin{aligned}
p\ce{OH} &= -\log(0.018) = 1.75\\
p\ce{H} &= 14.0 - p\ce{OH} = 14.0-1.75 = 12.25
\end{aligned}$$
```


### Weak acids and acid ionization constants

Most acids are weak and only partially ionize in water. At equilibrium, an aqueous solution of a weak acid contains a mixture of aqueous acid molecules, the corresponding conjugate base, and $\ce{H3O+}$. The degree to which a weak acid ionizes depends on the concentration of the acid and the equilibrium constant for the ionization.

Consider a weak monoprotic acid $\ce{HA}$, whose ionization in water can be represented as

$$\ce{
HA <=>[H2O] H+ + A-
}$$

The equilibrium expression for this reaction can be written as:

```{math}
:label: ka

K_a = \frac{\{\ce{H+}\}\{\ce{A-}\}}{\{\ce{HA}\}}
```

In Eq {eq}`ka` $K_a$  is special equilibrium constant called the ***acid ionization constant***. The magnitude of $K_a$ indicates the strength of an acid. A large $K_a$ value indicates a stronger acid, whereas a small $K_a$ value indicates a weaker acid.

Weak acids do not completely dissociate, hence we need to use the *ICE method* setup introduced in the previous chapter to solve  equilibrium problems.


```{dropdown} Example: Equilibrium $p\ce{H}$  of weak acid solutions 

Let's calculate  at equilibrium of $\pu{0.5 M}$ $\ce{HF}$ solution at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$. This equilibrium reaction is 

$$\ce{
HF + H2O <=> H3O+ + F- \qquad $K_a = \pu{7.1e-4}$
}$$

Let's setup the ICE table for this problem

|   | $\ce{HF(aq)}$ | $+$ | $\ce{H2O (l)}$ | $\rightleftharpoons$ | $\ce{H3O+ (aq)}$ | $+$ | $\ce{F- (aq)}$ |
|---|------------|-----|------|--------|---------------|-----|------|
| [I] | $0.5$      |     |      |       | $0$    |     | $0$         |
| [C] | $-x$       |     |   |     | $+x$          |     | $+x$        |
| [E] | $(0.5-x)$  |     |   |    | $(+x)$        |     | $(+x)$      |


We can now substitute these into Eq. {eq}`ka` 

$$K_a = \frac{\{\ce{H3O+}\}\{\ce{F-}\}}{\{\ce{HF}\}} = \frac{(+x)(+x)}{(0.5-x)} = \pu{7.1e-4}$$

The above expression can be simplified into a quadratic expression and be solved for $x$. In this case, $x = \pu{1.9e-2}$ or from the above table $\{\ce{H3O+}\} = x = \pu{1.9e-2}$ or $p\ce{H} = 1.72$. 
```

```{dropdown} Example: Relative abundance of weak acids 

We can calculate the relative abundance of conjugate base of a weak acid at any  by examining the equilibrium expression. In the $\ce{HF}$ ionization reaction shown in previous example, the expression can be rearranged as 

 $$
 \begin{align*}
    K_a &= \frac{\{\ce{H3O+}\}\{\ce{F-}\}}{\{\ce{HF}\}}\\
    \frac{\{\ce{F-}\}}{\{\ce{HF}\}} &= \frac{K_a}{\{\ce{H3O+}\}} 
\end{align*}
$$ 

For any given $\{\ce{H3O+}\}$ (or $p\ce{H}$), we can calculate the relative abundance of weak acids. We can express this ratio in $\%$ by multiplying by $100$.

Percent ionization is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{\{\ce{F-}\}}{\{\ce{HF}\}} \times \pu{100 \%}$$

### Carbonic acid system

Carbonic acid ($\ce{H2CO3}$) is the most abundant acid in natural waters and is also a weak acid. Along with its salt, $\ce{CaCO3}$, it forms a buffer that plays an important role in regulating the  of natural waters. Hence, an understanding of the carbonic acid system is essential to the understanding of the $p\ce{H}$ of natural waters.

$\ce{CO2(g)}$ dissolves in water in the sequence as shown below.  Closely, note the states of matter and the arrows between reactants and products.

```{math}
:label: co2-dissol
\begin{align*}
\ce{
CO2(g) &<=> CO2(aq) \\
CO2(aq) &<<=> H2CO3(aq) 
}
\end{align*}
```

The above two reactions cannot be separated and is often difficult to distinguish between $\ce{CO2(aq)}$ and $\ce{H2CO3(aq)}$. Often, scientists use the term $\ce{H2CO3^*}$ to denote the sum of $[\ce{CO2(aq)}]$ and $[\ce{H2CO3(aq)}]$. At $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$, $[\ce{CO2(aq)}]$  makes up $\pu{99.85 \%}$ of this sum, and may be more acceptable to the use of $\ce{H2CO3^*}$. In this text, we will use $\ce{H2CO3^*}$ to represent carbonic acid.

The equilibrium relationship of reaction {eq}`co2-dissol` can be expressed as

$$K_H = \frac{[\ce{CO2 (aq)}]}{P_{\ce{CO2 (g)}}} = \pu{10^{-1.47} mol L-1 atm-1}$$

The $K_H$ is a special equilibrium constant called the ***Henry's Law constant*** and is used for equilibrium reactions that involve dissolution of gases in water. Using the $K_H$, $[\ce{H2CO3^*}]$ can be calculated for different atmospheric concentrations.

```{dropdown} Example: Application of $K_H$

If we assume that $[\ce{CO2(g)}]$ is $\pu{400 ppm}$ (= $\pu{400e-6 atm}$),

$$\begin{aligned}
[\ce{CO2 (aq)}] &= K_H P_{\ce{CO2 (g)}} \\
&= \pu{10^{-1.47} mol L-1 atm-1} \times \pu{400e-6 atm} \\
&= \pu{10^{-4.87} mol L-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

```

At $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$, the $\ce{H2CO3^*}$ dissociates in water as follows,

```{math}
:label: h2co3-ka1ka2
\begin{align}
\ce{
H2CO3(aq) &<=> H+ (aq) + HCO3- (aq) \qquad $K_{a1} = \pu{4.47e-7}$\\
HCO3- (aq) &<=> H+ (aq) + CO3^2- (aq) \qquad $K_{a2} = \pu{4.68e-10}$
}
\end{align}
```

The relative abundance of $\ce{H2CO3^* (aq)}$, $\ce{HCO3- (aq)}$, and $\ce{CO3^2- (aq)}$ at any $p\ce{H}$ can be calculated by applying the Law of Mass Action expression to reactions {eq}`h2co3-ka1ka2`. These expressions can be rearranged and expressed as: 

```{math}
:label: co3-ka1-ka2-exp
\begin{align}
\frac{[\ce{H2CO3^* (aq)}]}{[\ce{HCO3- (aq)}]} &= \frac{[\ce{H3O+ (aq)}]}{K_{a1}}  \\
\frac{[\ce{HCO3- (aq)}]}{[\ce{CO3^2- (aq)}]} &= \frac{[\ce{H3O+ (aq)}]}{K_{a2}} 
\end{align}
```

The total carbonate concentration ($\ce{C}_T$) present in an aqueous system can be considered to be constant. If we assume that all carbonate is only present in this aqueous system in the forms of $\ce{H2CO3^* (aq)}$, $\ce{HCO3- (aq)}$, and $\ce{CO3^2- (aq)}$, we can use mass balance concepts to determine absolute abundance as follows:

```{math}
:label: ct-exp
\ce{C}_T = [\ce{H2CO3^* (aq)}] + [\ce{HCO3- (aq)}] + [\ce{CO3^2- (aq)}] 
```

Equilibrium expressions  {eq}`co3-ka1-ka2-exp` can be combined with equation {eq}`ct-exp` and simplified as:

```{math}
:label: ct-expanded
\ce{C}_T = [\ce{H2CO3^* (aq)}]\left(1 + \frac{K_{a1}}{[\ce{H3O+}]} + \frac{K_{a1} K_{a2}}{[\ce{H3O+}]^2}\right) 
```

We now have an expression that relates total carbonate to the amount of. This is a very useful expression as can be seen. In order to simplify subsequent equations, we will define a variable, $\alpha_\text{H}$, that encompasses all of the terms inside the parentheses in equation {eq}`ct-expanded`. Note that this portion of the equation deals with $p\ce{H}$  of the aqueous system.

```{math}
:label: alpha-h
\alpha_\ce{H} = \left(1 + \frac{K_{a1}}{[\ce{H3O+}]} + \frac{K_{a1} K_{a2}}{[\ce{H3O+}]^2}\right)
```

We can now determine $[\ce{H2CO3^* (aq)}]$, $[\ce{HCO3- (aq)}]$, and $[\ce{CO3^2- (aq)}]$, by combining equations eq {eq}`co3-ka1-ka2-exp` and {eq}`ct-expanded` as follows: 

```{math}
:label: ct-alpha
\begin{align}
[\ce{H2CO3^* (aq)}] &= \frac{\text{C}_T}{\alpha_\text{H}}\\
[\ce{HCO3^- (aq)}] &= \frac{\text{C}_T K_{a1}}{[\ce{H3O+}] \alpha_\text{H}}\\
[\ce{CO3^2- (aq)}] &= \frac{\text{C}_T K_{a1} K_{a2}}{[\ce{H3O+}]^2 \alpha_\text{H}}
\end{align}
```
 
If $\ce{C}_T$ and $p\ce{H}$ are known in any given system, all carbonate species concentrations can be determined.

### Silicic acid system

Silicic acid ($\ce{H4SiO4}$) is a common byproduct of silicate mineral weathering, and is a weak acid. This is "tetraprotic acid," meaning it can release four $\ce{H+}$ in four dissociation steps. Only the first two dissociation steps are environmentally relevant. At $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$, dissociates in water as follows,

```{math}
:label: silicate
\begin{align}
\ce{
H4SiO4 + H2O &<=> H3SiO4- + H3O+ \qquad  $K_{a1} = \pu{10^{-9.83}}$\\
H3SiO4- + H2O &<=> H2SiO4^2- + H3O+ \qquad  $K_{a2} = \pu{10^{-13.17}}$
}
\end{align}
```

### Weak bases and base ionization constants

Just as acids, most bases and only partially ionize in water. At equilibrium, an aqueous solution of a weak base contains a mixture of aqueous base molecules, $\ce{OH-}$, and the corresponding conjugate acid. The ionization can be treated very similar to that of a weak acid.

Consider a weak base $\ce{B}$ (and the conjugate acid, $\ce{HB+}$), whose ionization in water can be represented as

$$\ce{
B + H2O <=> HB+ + OH-
}$$

The equilibrium expression for this reaction can be written as:

```{math}
:label: kb

K_b = \frac{\{\ce{HB+}\}\{\ce{OH-}\}}{\{\ce{B}\}}
```

$K_b$  is special equilibrium constant called the ***base ionization constant***.

$K_a$ and $K_b$ are related to $K_w$ by following relationship.

```{math}
:label: kakb

K_a \times K_b = K_w
```


### Amphoteric Compounds

Many natural metal oxides (e.g., $\ce{Al2O3}$, $\ce{Fe2O3}$, both of which are common components of natural soils) and hydroxides (E.g., $\ce{Al(OH)3}$, $\ce{Fe(OH)3}$ - both are components of natural soils) can act as both acids and bases as they respond to change in the bulk solution conditions.

```{dropdown} Example: Amphoteric acids and bases

Aluminum oxide ($\ce{Al2O3}$) is amphoteric. Depending on the reaction conditions, it can behave either as an acidic oxide or as a basic oxide. For example, $\ce{Al2O3}$ acts as a base with hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl}$) to produce a salt ($\ce{AlCl3}$) and $\ce{H2O}$,

$$\ce{
Al2O3 + 6 HCl -> 2 AlCl3 + 3 H2O
}$$

and acts as an acid with sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$),

$$\ce{
Al2O3 + 2 NaOH + 3 H2O -> 2 NaAl(OH)4
}$$

Aluminum hydroxide reacts with both acids and bases in a similar fashion:

$$
\begin{align}
\ce{
Al(OH)3 + 3 H+ &-> Al^3+ + 3 H2O\\
Al(OH)3 + OH- &-> Al(OH)4^-
}
\end{align}$$
```

The amphoteric nature of metal oxides and hydroxides are often exploited in water and wastewater treatment as well as treatment of metal contaminated soils and groundwater. By adding acids or bases to solutions, metal contaminants in solid form could be "mobilized" into aqueous solutions.


## Common Ions and Buffer Solutions

A buffer solution resists changes to  when or are added. This is possible to solutions that contain a weak acid and its conjugate base (or a weak base and its conjugate acid). To understand how this works, let's explore the ***common ion effect*** easily observable in the acetic acid-acetate system.

```{dropdown} Example: Common ion effect 

Let's calculate $p\ce{H}$ of a $\pu{0.1 M}$ $\ce{CH3COOH}$ (acetic acid) solution. The $K_a$ for $\ce{CH3COOH}$ is $\pu{1.8e-5}$ at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$.

$$\ce{
CH3COOH <=> H+ + CH3COO- 
}$$

Let's calculate concentrations of all components at equilibrium using the ICE method.

|   | $\ce{CH3COOH (aq)}$ | $\ce{H+ (aq)}$ | $\ce{CH3COO- (aq)}$ |
|---|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| [I] | $0.1$            | $0$         | $0$              |
| [C] | $-x$             | $+x$        | $+x$             |
| [E] | $0.1-x$          | $+x$        | $+x$             |


The solution to this problem yields: $[\ce{CH3COOH (aq)}] = \pu{0.099 M}$, $[\ce{CH3COO- (aq)}] = [\ce{H+ (aq)}] = \pu{1.34e-3 M}$ or $p\ce{H} = 2.87$.

Now, let's add $\pu{0.05 M}$ of $\ce{CH3COONa}$ (the $\ce{Na}$ salt of acetic acid) to the above $\ce{CH3COOH (aq)}$ solution.  $\ce{CH3COONa}$ dissociates strongly into ionic form as follows:

$$\ce{
CH3COONa (aq) -> CH3COO- (aq) + Na+ (aq)
}$$

That is, the net effect of adding the above two reactions is to increase concentration of $\ce{CH3COO- (aq)}$ in the original reaction.  Le Châtelier's principle tells us that increasing product concentration will drive the reaction to the left.

$$ \ce{
CH3COOH (aq)) <<=>  H+ (aq) +  CH3COO- (aq)
} $$

This shift of equilibrium to the left consumes not only some of the $\ce{CH3COO- (aq)}$, but also some of the $\ce{H+ (aq)}$ (a strong acid) to form $\ce{CH3COOH (aq)}$, a weak acid.  Therefore, the $p\ce{H}$ of the solution increases.  Let's calculate the new equilibrium concentrations using the ICE method as above, but with different initial concentrations.

|   | $\ce{CH3COOH (aq)}$ | $\ce{H+ (aq)}$ | $\ce{CH3COO- (aq)}$|
|---|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| [I] | $0.099$      | $\pu{1.34e-3}$     | $\pu{5.134e-2}$     |
| [C] | $+y$             | $-y$              | $-y$               |
| [E] | $0.099+y$        | $\pu{1.34e-3} -y$ | $\pu{5.134e-2} -y$ |

The solution to this problem yields: [$\ce{H+ (aq)}$] = $\pu{3.6e-5 M}$ or $p\ce{H} = 4.44$, or as expected $p\ce{H}$ increased.
```

In the above solution, a soluble salt that contained a common ion added shifted the equilibrium to the left, thereby suppressing the ionization of the weak electrolyte. In general, when a compound containing an ion in common with a dissolved substance is added to a solution at equilibrium, the equilibrium shifts to the left. This phenomenon is known as the *common ion effect*. Note that the common ion can also be $\ce{H+}$ or $\ce{OH-}$. That is, addition of a strong acid to a solution of a weak acid suppresses ionization of the weak acid. Similarly, addition of a strong base to a solution of weak base suppresses ionization of the weak base.

```{dropdown} Example: Common ion effect due to addition of $\ce{H+}$ or $\ce{OH-}$

What happens when you add $\ce{H+}$ or $\ce{OH-}$ to the previous acetate system?

Adding $\ce{H+}$ to the acetate system:

$$\ce{
H+ + CH3COO- -> CH3COOH
}$$

Or, a strong acid ($\ce{H+}$) turns into a weak acid ($\ce{CH3COOH}$)!

Adding $\ce{OH-}$ to the acetate system:

$$\ce{
CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O
}$$

Or, a strong base ($\ce{OH-}$) turns into a weak base ($\ce{CH3COO-}$)!

This figure summarizes the buffering action of an $\ce{CH3COOH-CH3COO-}$ system.
```


```{dropdown} Example: Acetate buffer system 

Consider a solution that is $\pu{1.0 M}$ in $\ce{CH3COOH}$ and $\pu{1.0 M}$ $\ce{CH3COONa}$. Let's calculate $p\ce{H}$ of this system using the acetic acid reaction.

$$\ce{
CH3COOH <=> H+ + CH3COO- \qquad $K_{a} = \pu{1.8e-5}$
}$$

Let's calculate concentrations of all components at equilibrium using
the ICE method.

|   | $\ce{CH3COOH <=>}$ | $\ce{H+ +}$  | $\ce{CH3COO-}$ |
|---|-----------------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| [I] | $1.0$                             | $0$       | $1.0$        |
| [C] | $-x$                              | $+x$      | $+x$         |
| [E] | $1.0-x$                           | $+x$      | $1.0+x$      |

The solution to this problem yields a $p\ce{H} = 4.74$.

Now, let's add $\pu{0.1 M}$ of $\ce{HCl}$ to this system (assume that the addition of $\ce{HCl}$ doesn't change volume).  As seen in the previous example, all added $\ce{H+}$ is converted to $\ce{CH3COOH}$.	

$$\ce{
H+ + CH3COO- -> CH3COOH
}$$

|       | $\ce{H+ +}$ | $\ce{CH3COO- ->}$ | $\ce{CH3COOH}$ |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| On addition of $\ce{H+}$    | $0.1$     | $1.0$    | $1.0$        |
| On consumption of $\ce{H+}$ | $0$       | $0.9$    | $1.1$        |

Using the ICE approach, let's determine the final $p\ce{H}$ of this solution after adding $\ce{HCl}$.

|   | $\ce{CH3COOH <=>}$ | $\ce{H+ +}$  | $\ce{CH3COO-}$ |
|---|-----------------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| [I] | $1.1$                             | $0$       | $0.9$        |
| [C] | $-x$                              | $+x$      | $+x$         |
| [E] | $1.1-x$                           | $+x$      | $0.9+x$      |

The solution to this problem yields a $p\ce{H} = 4.66$. In other words, a drop of $0.08$ $p\ce{H}$ unit after addition of the strong acid. In contrast, if there were no acetate present in the solution, $p\ce{H}$ of pure water in the presence of $\pu{0.1 M}$ HCl would have been $1.0$ ($-\log[\ce{H+}] = -\log(0.1) = 1.0$)!
```

The final $p\ce{H}$ of a buffer solution can be determined using the ***Henderson-Hasselbalch equation***, which can be derived from equilibrium expression of dissociation of a weak acid. The final equation is given as:

```{math}
:label: henderson

p\ce{H} = pK_a + \log \frac{[\text{Conjugate Base}]}{[\text{Acid}]}
```

Equation {eq}`henderson` can be used to determine ideal concentrations and appropriate combinations of weak acids/conjugate bases that make effective buffer solutions.

```{dropdown} Example: Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation 

Let's use this equation to solve for the final $p\ce{H}$ when $\pu{0.1 M}$ of HCl was added to the solution containing $\pu{1.0 M}$ each of $\ce{CH3COOH}$ and $\ce{CH3COONa}$. From the previous example, we have [$\ce{CH3COOH}$] and [$\ce{CH3COO-}$] as $\pu{0.9 M}$ and $\pu{1.1 M}$, respectively. Substitute these values in Eq. {eq}`henderson`.

$$\begin{aligned}
    p\ce{H} &= pK_a + \log \frac{[\ce{CH3COO-}]}{[\ce{CH3COOH}]} \\
    &= 4.74 + \log \frac{\pu{0.9 M}}{\pu{1.1 M}}\\
    &= 4.65
\end{aligned}$$ 
This $p\ce{H}$ value is similar to the value obtained using the ICE approach.

### Soil Organic Matter

Soil carbon can act as a chemical buffer by regulating the $p\ce{H}$ of the soil. This is because soil carbon can help to stabilize the concentration of hydrogen ions in the soil, which in turn affects the $p\ce{H}$. Soil carbon can also help to buffer against changes in the concentration of other ions, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which can also influence the $p\ce{H}$ of the soil. In this way, soil carbon can help to maintain a relatively stable $p\ce{H}$ in the soil, which can be beneficial for plant growth and other soil processes.
