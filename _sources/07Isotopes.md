# Environmental Isotopes

In this chapter we will take a look at how different types of isotopes
are used in geological and environmental sciences.

## Introduction

### Isotopes in Geosciences

Radioisotopes are important for understanding the Earth in a number of ways. They can be used to date rocks and minerals, helping geologists to understand the history of the Earth and the processes that have shaped it. Radioisotopes can also be used to study the movements and behavior of elements in the Earth's crust and mantle, giving us a better understanding of the Earth's internal structure and processes. In addition, radioisotopes are used in the field of environmental science to study the movement of elements and compounds through ecosystems, and to understand the processes that control the distribution and behavior of elements in the environment.

Radioisotope decay is also harnessed to generate power. Nuclear power is generated through the process of nuclear fission. In a nuclear power plant, fuel rods containing uranium or other fissile materials are placed inside a reactor. When a neutron hits the nucleus of a uranium atom, it causes the nucleus to split into two smaller atoms, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This energy is used to heat water, which produces steam that drives a turbine connected to a generator. The generator converts the mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energy, which is then sent to the grid for distribution to homes and businesses.

The process of nuclear fission also releases additional neutrons, which can be captured by other uranium atoms, creating a chain reaction. The rate at which the chain reaction occurs is carefully controlled by the use of control rods, which can absorb excess neutrons and slow down the reaction. The heat produced by the nuclear reaction is removed from the reactor by a cooling system, which prevents the fuel rods from overheating and melting.

Nuclear power has the potential to be a low-carbon source of electricity that can help to address climate change. Because nuclear reactions release a large amount of energy with minimal carbon emissions, nuclear power plants can generate electricity with fewer greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuel-fired power plants.

However, nuclear power is not without its challenges. One of the main concerns is the management of nuclear waste, which can remain radioactive for thousands of years and requires careful disposal. In addition, the construction of nuclear power plants can be expensive and time-consuming, and there are concerns about the safety of nuclear power plants, especially in the wake of accidents such as the Fukushima disaster in Japan.

Overall, the role of nuclear power in addressing climate change will depend on the ability to address these challenges and on the availability of other low-carbon energy sources. Some experts believe that a mix of low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear power, will be necessary to meet the global demand for electricity while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Water isotopes, particularly isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, are used to study climate because they can provide information about the sources, movements, and histories of water in the Earth's hydrological cycle. Different isotopes of water have different properties and behave differently in the environment, so by measuring the relative abundance of different isotopes in water samples, scientists can learn about the conditions under which the water was formed and the processes it has undergone.

For example, the ratio of heavy isotopes (such as deuterium) to light isotopes (such as hydrogen) in water can be used to trace the source and movement of water, as well as to understand the temperature and humidity conditions in the atmosphere. Similarly, the ratio of oxygen isotopes in water can be used to infer information about the temperature and humidity of the air when the water was evaporated, as well as the altitude at which the water precipitated.

By studying the isotopic composition of water from various sources and locations, scientists can build a picture of the Earth's hydrological cycle and how it has changed over time, providing valuable insights into past and present climate conditions.

## What are isotopes?

Atoms that have same atomic number ($Z$), but different atomic mass ($M$), i.e., isotopes of the same number of protons ($\ce{p+}$), but different number of neutrons ($\ce{n^0}$). For example, the element hydrogen has three isotopes: $\ce{_1^{1}H}$ (protium), $\ce{_1^{2}H}$(deuterium), and $\ce{_1^{3}H}$ (tritium). By convention, the atomic number is shown in lower left side of the element symbol, while the atomic mass is shown on upper left side of the element symbol. Since, isotopes of the same element have the same atomic number, often the atomic number is not shown. The common way to show the hydrogen isotopes would be: $\ce{^{1}H}$, $\ce{^{2}H}$, and $\ce{^{3}H}$. In literature, you may also come across other naming conventions such as $\ce{C-14}$ or $\ce{U-238}$.

In calculation of atomic mass of an element, relative abundances of all isotopes and their respective masses are used to calculate a weighted average.

```{dropdown} Example: Calculation of atomic mass 

Naturally occurring hydrogen is found to consist of three isotopes:

1. $\pu{99.9885 \%}$ whose isotopic weight is $1.007825$
2. $\pu{0.0115 \%}$ whose isotopic weight is $2.01410178$
3. $\pu{0 \%}$ whose isotopic weight is $3.016049277$

Let's calculate the atomic weight of an average naturally occurring sample of a hydrogen atom. We can calculate the weighted average as follows: 

$$\begin{align}
    \text{Atomic Weight} &= \frac{99.9885}{100}\times 1.007825 \\
    &+ \frac{0.0115}{100}\times 2.01410178 \\
    &+ \frac{0}{100}\times 3.016049277 \\
    &= \pu{1.00794 amu}
\end{align}$$

```


## Radioisotopes

The number of neutrons in the nucleus of an element can be variable, giving rise to isotopes. Many isotopes are not stable and some will spontaneously transform from one form to another. This process is termed radioactive decay, and an isotope that undergoes radioactive decay is termed a radioisotope.

In the example of $\ce{H}$ isotopes is a radioisotope. Similarly, $\ce{^{14}C}$ is a radioisotope of $\ce{C}$, that is employed in many geological and environmental applications. Within the periodic table, majority of the elements have stable and radioisotopes. All elements with $Z>83$ are radioisotopes. The elements $\ce{Tc}$ ($Z=43$) and $\ce{Pm}$ ($Z=61$) have no stable isotopes.

### Decay Mechanisms

Why are radioisotopes unstable? The nucleus of a radioisotope is unstable because the total energy content of its nucleus is greater than that of a neighboring stable nucleus. There are several processes by which a radioisotope can become stable. When radioisotopes decay, they release various forms of subatomic particles as well as energy. For example, {numref}`u238-decay` shows how decays into more stable isotopes.


```{figure} https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Decay_chain%284n%2B2%2C_Uranium_series%29.svg/800px-Decay_chain%284n%2B2%2C_Uranium_series%29.svg.png

```

This decay process can be shown as a chemical reaction:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{Parent -> Daughter + subatomic  particle + energy
}
\end{align*}
$$

Radioisotopes of low mass numbers generally attempt to become stable by ***beta ($\beta$) decay***. There are two forms of $\beta$ decay. In beta- ($\beta^-$) decay a neutron ($\ce{n^0}$) converts into a proton ($\ce{p+}$) and an electron ($\ce{e-}$) as shown below.

$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{n^0 -> p+ + e-}
\end{align*}
$$


```{dropdown} Example: $\beta^-$ decay 

The isotope $\ce{^{14}C}$ decays in this manner.

$$
\ce{_6^{14}C -> _7^{14}N + e-}
$$

Because the neutron converts to a proton, the mass number of the isotope does not change, but the atomic number increases by 1.
```


In beta+ ($\beta^+$or positron) decay, a proton ($\ce{p+}$) can decay into a neutron ($\ce{n^0}$) and a positron (a positively charged electron, $\ce{e+}$). Again, the mass number does not change, but the atomic number decreases by 1 as there is one less proton in the nucleus as shown below.

$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{p+ -> n^0 + e+}
\end{align*}
$$

```{dropdown} Example: $\beta^+$ decay 

The isotope $\ce{^{18}F}$ decays in this manner.

$$
\ce{_9^{18}F -> _8^{18}O + e+}
$$

The mass number did not change, but the atomic number decreased by 1 as there is one less proton in the nucleus.
```

A proton can also convert into a neutron by capturing an orbiting electron, emitting X-ray radiation in the process as shown in the reaction below. This process is called ***electron capture***.

$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{p+ + e-  -> n^0 + X-rays}
\end{align*}
$$


```{dropdown} Example: Electron capture 

The isotope $\ce{^{18}F}$ can capture an $\ce{e-}$ and emit X-rays as shown below. 

$$
\ce{_9^{18}F + e- -> _8^{18}O + X-rays}
$$


The mass number did not change, but the atomic number decreased by 1 as there is one less proton in the nucleus.

```

Neutron-rich radioisotopes tend to undergo decay by $\beta^-$ decay process, whereas neutron-poor radioisotopes undergo $\beta^+$ decay or electron capture. Many radioisotopes require repeated $\beta$ decays to become stable.  For example, radioactive $\ce{_{54}^{140}Xe}$, which undergoes four successive $\beta-$ decays to form stable $\ce{_{58}^{140}Ce}$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{
_{54}^{140}Xe -> _{55}^{140}Cs ->_{56}^{140}Ba  -> _{57}^{140}La -> _{58}^{140}Ce
}
\end{align*}
$$

For the heavier radioisotopes the number of beta decays would be enormous, and so they undergo a different kind of radioactive decay process. This is known as ***alpha ($\alpha$) decay*** and involves the ejection of an $\alpha$ particle (i.e., $\ce{_2^{4}\alpha}$ or $\ce{_2^{4}He}$) from the nucleus.

```{dropdown} Example: Alpha decay 

The isotope $\ce{_{94}^{239}Pu}$ decays to $\ce{_{92}^{235}U}$ by this process.

$$
\ce{_{94}^{239}Pu -> _{92}^{235}U + _{2}^{4}He}
$$

The loss of means that the mass number decreases by 4, whereas the atomic number decreases by 2.

```

The $\alpha$ particle is ejected at speed, and due to its mass is the most ionizing but the least penetrating form of radiation. A sheet of paper can block this form of radiation.

Another form of radioactive decay is that of spontaneous fission. In this process, a heavy radioisotope will split into two medium-weight nuclei, which are called fission products. These are commonly radioactive themselves.

```{dropdown} Example: Spontaneous fission 

An example is the fission of $\ce{_{98}^{252}Cf}$, which splits with the emission of two neutrons.

$$
\ce{_{98}^{252}Cf -> _{48}^{120}Cd + _{50}^{130}Sn + 2 n^0}
$$

The atomic numbers of cadmium (48) and tin (50) add up to the atomic number of californium (98) because there is no change in the total number of protons, and the total mass of the products including the two neutrons adds up to 252, the mass number of $\ce{_{98}^{252}Cf}$.

```

The last form of radioactive decay is that of ***gamma ($\gamma$) decay***. Here, the radioisotopes are in an excited (i.e., high-energy) state. The majority of alpha and beta decays result in excited-state daughter nuclei, and these lose energy to go to their ground (i.e., low-energy) state by emitting gamma ($\gamma$) radiation. This gamma radiation is actually very-short-wavelength electromagnetic radiation similar to X-rays.

```{dropdown} Example: Gamma decay 

An example is the decay of $\ce{_{55}^{137}Cs}$ by $\ce{_{-1}^{0}\beta}$ decay to $\ce{_{56}^{137}Ba}$, which then emits $\gamma$ radiation to lose energy

$$
\ce{
_{55}^{137}Cs -> _{56}^{137}Ba (exited state) -> _{56}^{137}Ba + \gamma
}
$$

### Quantifying Decay

Radioactive decay is a random process, and it is not possible to predict when any one particular atom will decay. The rate at which a particular radioisotope decays obeys first order kinetics. If the number of isotope atoms are represented as $N$, the rate of decay can be expressed as follows: 

```{math}
:label: radio-decay
\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N
```
where, $\lambda$ is the radioactive decay constant (similar to the rate constant, $\kappa$ described in the previous chapter.) We can integrate the above equation and derive the following solution:

```{math}
:label: radio-decay-equation
\begin{aligned}
\ln \frac{N_t}{N_0} &= -\lambda t \\
\text{or, }
N &= N_0 e^{-\lambda t} 
\end{aligned}
```

where, $N_0$ is the number of unchanged atoms at $t=0$, and $N_t$ is the number of atoms available at time, $t$.

Since, the radioisotope is unstable and decaying according to first order kinetics, the time required for an isotope to reach half it's original mass or concentration is called half-life. That is, at half-life, $N_t = \dfrac{N_0}{2}$. If we make appropriate substitutions to Eq. {eq}`radio-decay-equation`, 

```{math}
:label: 
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2} &= e^{-\lambda t_{1/2}} \\
\text{or,} 
t_{1/2} &= \frac{0.693}{\lambda}
\end{aligned}
```

Consider the radioactive decay of $\ce{^{238}U}$ to $\ce{^{234}Th}$. $\ce{^{238}U}$ is the radioactive parent and $\ce{^{234}Th}$ is the radiogenic daughter. For any closed system at time $t$, the number of daughter atoms produced plus the number of parent atoms remaining must equal the total number of parent atoms at the start. If we substitute $D$ for the number of daughter atoms produced in Eq. {eq}`parent-daughter`, we get 

```{math}
:label: parent-daughter
N = (N+D) e^{-\lambda t}
```

If we assume that the $D$ is not a radioisotope, we can simplify Eq. {eq}`radio-decay-equation` to determine the number of daughter atoms formed as the parent atoms decays

```{math}
:label: 
D = N_0(1-e^{-\lambda t})
```

The relationship between the decay of a radioisotope and the growth of a daughter can be seen in {numref}`parent-daughter-fig`.

## Stable Isotopes

Stable isotopes do not spontaneously break down to form other isotopes. Because of relative differences in masses of isotopes of an element, changes to isotopic ratios can be observed during various biogeochemical processes. Study of stable isotopes is useful in gaining better understanding in environmental and geological studies.

Stable isotopes are especially useful in elements whose isotopes have large relative mass differences. Therefore, most of the elements used for stable isotope studies have a low atomic number and atomic mass ({numref}`stable-isotopes`). For isotopes with an atomic mass of greater than $40$, the relative mass differences are too small for any measurable isotopic fractionation. Most elements used in radiometric dating have high atomic mass, and mass fractionation is not significant.

```{table} Distribution of stable isotopes of most commonly-used elements.

### Stable Isotope Fractionation

Isotopic fractionation is the partitioning of isotopes during physical (evaporation, condensation, melting, crystallization, absorption and desorption, diffusion), chemical, or biological processes. This partitioning is proportional to the difference in the masses of the isotopes. The processes can either be equilibrium reactions, in which forward and backward reaction rates are equal for each isotope, or kinetic reactions, which are unidirectional reactions in which reaction rates are dependent on the masses of the isotopes and their vibrational energies.

```{dropdown} Example: Stable isotope fractionation of $\ce{H2O}$

During evaporation of  in a closed system, six isotope combinations of $\ce{H2O}$ are possible: $\ce{^1H2^{16}O}, \ce{^1H^2H^{16}O}, \ce{^2H2^{16}O}, \ce{^1H2^{18}O}, \ce{^1H^2H^{18}O}, \ce{^2H2^{18}O}$.

As a result of these different stable isotope combinations, the molecular masses are $18$, $19$, $20$, $20$, $21$, and $22$ respectively. See the conceptulizations in the figure below.

![# Water Isotopes Diagram - USGS](https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/Fig%201.Isotopes.web_.jpg)

```

Why do stable isotopes fractionate? Isotopically lighter isotopes have higher velocities than heavier isotopes. From basic physics, kinetic energy of a particle can be calculated using the following formula:

```{math}
:label: kineticenergy
\text{Kinetic Energy} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
```

Per Eqn. {eq}`kineticenergy`, isotopically lighter molecules that have higher velocities and therefore, greater amount of kinetic energy. Consider the above water example. Since the lighter molecules have greater velocities, they preferentially escape into the vapor phase resulting in enrichment of the lighter isotopes ( and ), relative to the liquid phase of water. In addition, atoms with greater mass form slightly stronger bonds, the heavier isotope is generally enriched in the more condensed phase or larger molecule.

```{dropdown} Example: Fractionation of water between phases 

Consider the equilibrium exchange of water between different phases:

$$\ce{
H2O(s) <=> H2O(l) <=> H2O(g)
}$$

As we know, the molecules of water are held together by weak hydrogen bonds.  These intermolecular bonds are strongest in the solid phase and weakest in the vapor phase.  In addition, there is slightly greater hydrogen bond strength for $\ce{H2^{18}O-H2O}$ versus $\ce{H2^{16}O-H2O}$ bonds, the $\ce{^{16}O}$ bonds will be more easily broken during evaporation. Therefore a lower concentration of $\ce{H2^{18}O}$ is present in the water vapor than in the liquid water, and so water is isotopically enriched over its vapor. Similarly, $\ce{^{18}O}$ is more enriched in ice than in water. 

```


```{dropdown} Example: Fractionation of $\ce{CaCO3}$ during dissolution 

Consider the chemical weathering of limestone ($\ce{CaCO3}$):

$$\ce{
CaCO3 ->[Acid] CaO + CO2
}$$

In this reaction $\ce{CO2}$ escapes and thus does not equilibrate with the solid phase. During a chemical reaction the lighter isotope is more reactive and is concentrated in the products. The relative loss of the lighter isotope from the reactants leads to an enrichment of the reactants in the heavier isotope. In this example, the gas phase (product) is enriched in the lighter isotopes of C and O, and the enrichment is significantly greater than that which would occur during an equilibrium reaction.

```

The partitioning of stable isotopes between two substances, $A$ and $B$, is described by the isotopic fractionation factor, $\alpha$. The fractionation factor is written as 

```{math}
:label: alpha
\alpha = \frac{R_A}{R_B}
```

where, $R$ is ratio of heavy to light isotope abundance (e.g., $\ce{^2 H}$/$\ce{^1 H}$  , $\ce{^{18}O}$/$\ce{^{16}O}$ ). Generally, the isotope abundance ratio does not greatly vary in the environment, and so the fractionation factor, $\alpha$, generally has a value close to 1. However, this value can be precisely measured and so is expressed with a precision of 4-5 decimal places. The fractionation factor depends on the temperature and can be determined either experimentally or calculated from spectroscopic data.

```{dropdown} Example: Isotope fractionation factor 

Consider the evaporation of water. We can setup the fractionation ratio and factor as follows:

$$R = \frac{\ce{^{18}O}}{\ce{^{16}O}}
$$ 
We can calculate $\alpha$ as

$$\alpha = \frac{\ce{^{18}O}/\ce{^{16}O}_{\text{(liquid)}}}{\ce{^{18}O}/\ce{^{16}O}_{\text{(vapor)}}}
$$

Since $\ce{^{16}O}$ is enriched in the vapor phase relative to the liquid,

$$
[\ce{^{18}O}]_{\text{vapor}} > [\ce{^{16}O}]_{\text{liquid}}
$$

Conversely, $\ce{^{18}O}$ is enriched in the liquid relative to the vapor,

$$
[\ce{^{18}O}]_{\text{liquid}} > [\ce{^{18}O}]_{\text{vapor}}$$

Therefore, the fractionation factor is greater than 1. With increasing temperature, the fractionation factor decreases, and it becomes 1 at infinite temperature.

```

In {numref}`oxygen-fractionation`, isotope fractionation of $\ce{O}$ as a function of temperature during evaporation of $\ce{H2O}$ is shown. Paleoclimatologists use $\ce{O}$ ratios ($\ce{^{18}O}$/$\ce{^{16}O}$) from $\ce{H2O}$ trapped in glaciers as well as the $\ce{O}$ absorbed in the shells of marine plants and animals to measure past temperatures and rainfall. In polar ice cores, the measurement is relatively simple: less $\ce{^{18}O}$ in the frozen water means that temperatures were cooler.  In shells, the measurement is far more complicated because the biological and chemical processes that form the shells skew the $\ce{O}$ ratio in different ways depending on temperature.

```{figure} https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/ContentFeature/Paleoclimatology_OxygenBalance/images/oxygen_schematic.jpg

figclass: margin-caption
---
Water vapor gradually loses $\ce{^{18}O}$ as it travels from the equator to the poles. Because water molecules with heavy $\ce{^{18}O}$ isotopes in them condense more easily than normal water molecules, air becomes progressively depleted in $\ce{^{18}O}$ as it travels to high latitudes and becomes colder and drier. In turn, the snow that forms most glacial ice is also depleted in $\ce{^{18}O}$. Image source: [Paleoclimatology: The Oxygen Balance (nasa.gov)](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Paleoclimatology_OxygenBalance)
```

The isotopic fractionation factor is related to the equilibrium constant ($K$) of a reaction as follows: 

```{math}
:label: alphak
\alpha = K^\frac{1}{n}
```
 Where $K$ is the equilibrium constant and $n$ is the number of atoms exchanged.

```{dropdown} Example: Isotope fractionation factor and $K$ 

Consider the exchange of $\ce{O}$ isotopes between carbonate ($\ce{CaCO3}$) and water. This particular reaction is of interest because it is used as a "paleothermometer" in marine systems. The fractionation factor can help determine temperature of water at the time of deposition of carbonate.

Let's write the reaction in terms of a single oxygen, so $n = 1$ in Eq. {eq}`alphak`,

$$
\ce{
1/3 CaC^{16}O3 + H2^{18}O <=> 1/3 CaC^{18}O3 + H2^{16}O
}$$

Writing this equation in terms of the equilibrium constant, $K$,

$$K = \frac{([\ce{CaC^{18}O3}]^{1/3} [\ce{H2^{16}O}])}{([\ce{CaC^{16}O3}]^{1/3} [\ce{H2^{18}O}])}$$

Rearranging this equation with $\ce{CaCO3}$ separated from $\ce{H2O}$,

$$K = \frac{([\ce{CaC^{18}O3}]/[\ce{CaC^{16}O3}])^{1/3}}{[\ce{H2^{18}O}]/ [\ce{H2^{16}O}]}$$

Therefore,

$$K = \alpha = \frac{R_\text{Carbonate}}{R_\ce{H2O}} = \frac{\ce{^{18}O}/\ce{^{18}O}\, \text{of}\, \ce{CaCO3}}{\ce{^{18}O}/\ce{^{18}O}\, \text{of}\, \ce{H2O}}$$

Because the isotopic fractionation factor varies as a function of temperature, the measured fractionation factor can be compared to emprirical values to determine the equilibrium temperature for the calcium carbonate-water reaction.
```


### The $\delta$ notation

$R$ values for environmental samples have to be compared with a fixed value (or a standard) to know if that sample is enriched or depleted compared to the standard.

Since isotopic variations between samples are very small, we express isotopic ratios using delta ($\delta$) notation. This value is determined by comparing the isotopic ratio ($R$) of a sample with that of a standard and calculated as follows:

```{math}
:label: delta
\delta = \left(\frac{R_\text{Sample}}{R_\text{Standard}} - 1\right) \times 1000
```

Where the isotopic ratio, $R$, has been defined in the previous section. Note that the ratio is multiplied by a thousand and is expressed in "parts per thousand" or permille or permil or the symbol, $\pu{‰}$. As seen in Eqn. {eq}`delta`, $R_\text{Standard}$ is required for the element of interest. Standards for most common elements of interest have been adopted worldwide for research purposes and shown in {numref}`isotopestandards`. Typically, V-SMOW (Vienna standard mean ocean water), and PDB (Pee Dee beleminite) are most commonly used for $\ce{H}$, $\ce{O}$, and $\ce{C}$ ratios.

```{table} Isotope ratios and standards for most commonly-used elements in environmental geosciences.
:name: isotopestandards
| Isotope Ratio   | Standard | $R \times \pu{e-5}$ |
|--------------|----------|----------: |
| $\ce{^2 H}$/$\ce{^1 H}$   | V-SMOW   | $15.575$ |
| $\ce{^{13} C}$/$\ce{^{12} C}$ | PDB      | $1123.75$   |
| $\ce{^{18} O}$/$\ce{^{16} O}$ | V-SMOW   | $200.52$    |
| $\ce{^{18} O}$/$\ce{^{16} O}$ | PDB      | $206.72$   |
| $\ce{^{15} N}$/$\ce{^{14} N}$ | NBS-14   | $367.6 $   |
| $\ce{^{34} S}$/$\ce{^{32} S}$ | CDT      | $4499.4$   |

When $\delta$ values are negative, $R_\text{Sample} < R_\text{Standard}$ in Eqn. {eq}`delta`, therefore, the sample is considered to be depleted compared with the standard. Similarly, when $\delta$ values are positive, $R_\text{Sample} > R_\text{Standard}$, therefore, the sample is considered to be enriched compared to the standard.

Since the $\delta$ values and the isotope fractionation factors ($\alpha$) are derived from isotopic ratios, they are correlated with each other. Once again, let's look at fractionation of between water (liquid) and vapor and express the fractionation factor, $\alpha$, in terms of the $\delta \ce{^{18}O}$ values of the water and vapor by combining Eqn. {eq}`alpha` and Eqn. {eq}`delta`.

```{math}
:label: alphadelta
\alpha \ce{^{18}O}_{\text{water-liquid-vapor}} = \frac{\delta \ce{^{18}O}_{\text{liquid water}}+1000}{\delta \ce{^{18}O}_{\text{vapor water }}+1000}
```


```{dropdown} Example: $\delta$ notation 

A rainwater sample collected in Boston, Massachusetts, has an $\ce{^{18} O}$/$\ce{^{16} O}$ ratio of $0.0019750$. Calculate $\delta$ for this rainwater sample.

From {numref}`isotopestandards`, we can read the isotopic ratio of $\ce{^{18} O}$/$\ce{^{16} O}$ in V-SMOW to be $0.0020052$. Substitute values in Eqn. {eq}`delta` as follows: 

$$\begin{align}
\delta &=  \left(\frac{\ce{^{18}O}/\ce{^{16}O}_\text{Sample}}{\ce{^{18}O}/\ce{^{16}O}_\text{Standard}} - 1\right) \times 1000\\ &=\left(\frac{0.0019750}{0.0020052} - 1\right) \times 1000 = \pu{-15.1 ‰} 
\end{align}$$

Since this final value is negative, the sample isotopically lighter than the standard.

### Stable isotopes and the water cycle

Isotopes provide a great tool for distinguishing different water sources and recharge areas during analysis of the water cycle. The natural isotopes and are an intrinsic component of the water molecule and so are ideal tracers. They are selectively partitioned at each step of the water cycle, from primary evaporation over the oceans, through condensation and precipitation to groundwater recharge and runoff back to the seas.

The principal hydrological processes that affect the distribution of isotopes through the hydrological cycle include the following:

1. Evaporation and formation of atmospheric vapor
2. Condensation and rain out with decreasing temperature
3. Reevaporation from soils and surface waters, which enriches the residual water in both isotopes
4. Mixing during recharge and groundwater flow

Based on experimental observations of water isotopes around the world at different latitudes, it has been observed that $\ce{^{18}O}$ and $\ce{^{2}H}$ in freshwater are enriched in warm regions and depleted in cold regions, with a range of $\delta \ce{^{18}O} > \pu{40 ‰}$ and $\delta \ce{^{2}H} > \pu{300 ‰}$. In addition, there is a strong linear correlation between $\delta \ce{^{18}O}$ and $\delta \ce{^{2}H}$ in meteoric waters, with a slope of $8$ and deuterium intercept of $\pu{10}$. This linear correlation is called the ***Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL)*** and describes the global annual average relationship between $\delta \ce{^{18}O}$ and $\delta \ce{^{2}H}$ in natural [meteoric waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoric_water "Meteoric water").

\delta \ce{^{2}H} = 8 \delta \ce{^{18}O} + 10

```

The mean global meteoric water line (GMWL) is based on numerous analyses of meteoric waters collected at different latitudes and represents a global average. Local meteoric water lines are determined by measuring the isotopic composition of meteoric waters from a restricted geographic area.

The ***Local Meteoric Water Line*** (LMWL) can diverge from the GMWL depending on the climate of that region. The LMWL can differ from GMWL in slope and intercept - the deviation is mainly from climate factors that impact precipitation patterns.

## Practice Problems

(1) Assume that in 1951, before the first atmospheric tests of fusion bombs, the concentration of $\ce{^3H}$ in rainwater was $\pu{8 TU}$. Calculate the concentration for pre-bomb in a present-day groundwater reservoir. $(\lambda = \pu{5.575e-2 y-1})$ Note: $\pu{1 TU} = 1\, \ce{^3H}$ per  $\pu{e18}\, \ce{H}$ atoms.

(2) $\ce{^{14}C}$ activity of modern-day $\ce{C}$ is $\pu{13.56 dpm g−1}$. If a charcoal from an ancient fire has an activity of $\pu{6.22 dpm g−1}$, how old was the fire? $(\lambda = \pu{1.209e-4 y-1})$. Note: *dpm* refers to *disintegrations* (of the radioisotope) *per minute*.

(3) $\ce{^{137}Cs}$ is often used to radio-date fresh surface sediment, and its $t_{1/2} = \pu{30 y}$. From an original sample of $\pu{80 g}$ of $\ce{^{137}Cs}$, how much is left in $\pu{80 y}$?

(4) $\ce{^{230}Th}$ activity in surface of a marine sediment core is $\pu{62 dpm}$ and $\pu{28 dpm}$ at $\pu{1 m}$ depth. $(\lambda = \pu{9.217e-6 y-1})$. (a) What is the age of sediment at $\pu{1 m}$ depth? (b) What is the sedimentation age in $\pu{m y-1}$.

(5) A water sample has a $\delta \ce{^{18}O}$ value of $\pu{−4.5 ‰}$. It is in equilibrium with water vapor at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$. The fractionation factor at $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$ is $1.0093$. What is the $\delta \ce{^{18}O}$ value of the water vapor? Answer: $\pu{−13.67 ‰}$

(6) For Greenland, average summer temperatures are $\pu{0 ^\circ C}$ and average winter temperatures are $\pu{-30 ^\circ C}$. The fractionation factors for $\delta \ce{^{18}O}$ are: at $\pu{-30 ^\circ C}$, $\alpha = 1.0155$ and at $\pu{0 ^\circ C}$, $\alpha = 1.0112$. Calculate the isotopic composition of snow formed during the summer and winter seasons. Answer: Summer = $\pu{−24.4 ‰}$ and winter = $\pu{−29.9 ‰}$

(7) A water sample was measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry to have a $\ce{^{18}O/^{16}O}$ ratio $R = 0.00199517$ with VSMOW ($R = 0.00200520$). What is its $\delta$ value (rounded to one decimal place)?
