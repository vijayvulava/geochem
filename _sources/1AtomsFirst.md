## Introduction 
  
From the universe's origins to the significant development of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, chemical elements are vital for our understanding of nature.
  
Chemistry is the study of matter's composition, properties, and structure, as well as how substances can change into different forms. However, this definition is too broad to be helpful since geologists and environmental scientists also examine the composition and transformations of matter. Geologists, for instance, study minerals, which change through geological processes like volcanism and chemical weathering, as well as a broader understanding of plate tectonics.
  
Geochemists and chemists analyze and explain the properties of over a hundred elements found in all matter and the various molecules formed by creating and breaking bonds between atoms. Consequently, chemistry is defined more by its approach than its specific subject matter. It encompasses the study of any topic related to the properties of atoms and molecules.
  
Chemistry plays a crucial role in Geology, providing a unique perspective. For example, [The Earth Scientist's Periodic Table](http://railsback.org/PT.html) has been designed explicitly from an Earth sciences perspective.

The _Earth Scientist's Periodic Table of the Elements and Their Ions_ is a new periodic table designed to contextualize trends in geochemistry, mineralogy, aqueous chemistry, and other natural sciences.

This chapter will review some fundamental concepts of introductory college chemistry, particularly those discussed in depth during the first semester of a two-semester college chemistry course (e.g., CHEM 111).

## Learning Goals
  
```{admonition} Learning Goals
 
The main goals for this chapter are to: 
1. define basic atomic principles,
2. identify different expressions of mass and concentrations and
3. understand the organization and trends in the periodic table.
